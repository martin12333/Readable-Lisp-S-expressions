* sweet-clisp - fix adjacent initial-indent when used interactively:
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
  Currently 5 and 6 not returned.
  Yet it DOES work if you put these in a file (.lisp or .slisp),
  and it works for sbcl in all cases.  It's specific to clisp.

* eval-when: Do we need it?  When? Can we embed it?
  (Need to test with sbcl)
