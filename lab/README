This the "lab" directory, where you can find older experiments,
eye of newt, and other odd things.  These are being kept (for the moment)
in the file set as items that might be useful.

These include:

* neoteric.cl: A partial implementation of neoteric-expressions
  in Scheme.

* iexpr.scm: An update from SRFI-49 that attempted to fix its bugs and
  limitations for indentation processing, while staying with its
  notation relatively closely.  Eventually we moved on and made
  enough changes that sweet-expressions are really a different notation,
  though it's heavily influenced by SRFI-49 and its implementation
  is derived from this.
