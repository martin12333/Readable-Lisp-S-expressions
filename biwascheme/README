`biwascheme/` Directory
=======================

This directory contains a simple `sweetbiwa.html` file that,
when loaded, provides an online REPL to BiwaScheme, but
using sweet-expressions rather than s-expressions.

To make that work, first get BiwaScheme in a completely
separate directory, probably via this command:

    git clone https://github.com/biwascheme/biwascheme.git biwascheme_js

Then make *just* the `biwascheme.js` file:

    cd biwascheme_js/
    make release/biwascheme.js

Then copy the resulting file `release/biwascheme.js` to
this directory and open the `sweetbiwa.html` file in a
js-capable browser.

`sweetbiwa.html` should be constructed by the `Makefile`
in the main directory.  The file `sweetbiwa.html.in` is
the source.
