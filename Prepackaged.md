Here is a list of some prepackaged implementations of readable Lisp capabilities (this is probably very incomplete):

*   [Guile Scheme version 2.0.7 (released 2012-11-30) and later implement SRFI-105 (curly-infix)](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/SRFI_002d105.html).  Just use #!curly-infix.
*   [Mac OS X "Homebrew"](http://brew.sh/) includes our readable package, just use "brew install readable".  As of 2014-06-14 it only supported Scheme, not Common Lisp.  Our thanks to Elliott Cable for packaging it!
*   [Quicklisp (for Common Lisp)](http://www.quicklisp.org/) includes readable libraries for Common Lisp.

See [Install-howto] for how to install the readable software from source code if this list doesn't meet your needs.
