<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>Lisp-based languages, like Scheme, are almost the only
programming languages in modern use that do not support infix notation.
Adding standardized infix support to Scheme would eliminate a common
complaint by developers who currently choose to use other languages.
Scheme currently reserves <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>
&ldquo;for possible future extensions to the language&rdquo;.
We propose that <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> be used
to support &ldquo;curly-infix&rdquo; notation as a homoiconic
reader abbreviation, just as
<samp>&apos;x</samp> is an abbreviation for <samp>(quote&nbsp;x)</samp>.
Curly-infix lists are lists whose visual presentation is in
infix order instead of prefix order.
For example,
<samp>{n&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;2}</samp> maps to <samp>(&gt;&nbsp;n&nbsp;2)</samp>,
and
<samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&nbsp;+&nbsp;c}</samp> maps to
<samp>(+&nbsp;a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c)</samp>.
By intent, there is no precedence, but e.g.,
<samp>{x&nbsp;+&nbsp;{y&nbsp;*&nbsp;z}}</samp>
maps cleanly to
<samp>(+&nbsp;x&nbsp;(*&nbsp;y&nbsp;z))</samp>.
Forms implying precedence have &ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo; prepended to
enable later macro processing, e.g.,
<samp>{2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;*&nbsp;5}</samp>
maps to
<samp>(nfx&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;*&nbsp;5)</samp>.</p>

<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>
<p>Lisp-based languages, like Scheme, are almost the only
programming languages in modern use that do not support infix
notation. Even some Lisp advocates, like Paul Graham, admit that
they &ldquo;don&#8217;t find prefix math expressions
natural&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html"
rel="nofollow">http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html</a>).
Paul Prescod has said, &ldquo;I have more faith that you could convince
the world to use Esperanto than prefix notation&rdquo;
(<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg01571.html" rel="nofollow">http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg01571.html</a>).
Infix is not going away; standard mathematical notation uses infix,
infix notation is taught to most people (programmers or not) in school,
and nearly all new programming languages include infix.
Adding infix support to Scheme would eliminate a common complaint
by developers who currently choose to use other languages instead.</p>
<p>Scheme currently reserves
<code>{</code>...<code>}</code> &ldquo;for possible future
extensions to the language&rdquo;. We propose that
<code>{</code>...<code>}</code> be used to
support &ldquo;curly-infix&rdquo; notation as a reader
abbreviation, just as
<samp>&apos;x</samp> is an abbreviation for <samp>(quote&nbsp;x)</samp> and
<samp>(x&nbsp;y&nbsp;z)</samp>
is an abbreviation for
<samp>(x&nbsp;.&nbsp;(y&nbsp;.&nbsp;(z&nbsp;.&nbsp;())))</samp>.
</p>
<p>This proposal is an extremely <em>simple</em> and
<em>straightforward</em> technique for supporting infix notation.
There is no complex precedence system, all other Scheme
capabilities (including macros and quasiquoting) work unchanged,
any symbol can be used as an infix operation where desired,
and Scheme remains general and homoiconic.
Curly-infix expressions
are just a convenient reader abbreviation for infix notation.</p>
<p>At its core, this SRFI provides
the <em>simple</em> curly-infix list that accepts ordinary
lists, merely written in a different order.
The simple curly-infix list
<samp>{operand-1 operator operand-2 operator operand-3 operator ...}</samp>
is mapped to
<samp>(operator operand-1 operand-2 operand-3 ...)</samp> so that more than
two operands are handled cleanly.
E.g., <samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&nbsp;+&nbsp;c}</samp> maps to
<samp>(+&nbsp;a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c)</samp>.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_whychangethereader">Why change the reader?</h2>
<p>Many previous systems have implemented &ldquo;infix&rdquo;
systems as a named macro or procedure (e.g., <var>INFIX</var>). This looks
ugly, and it does the wrong thing - the resulting list always has
<var>INFIX</var> at the beginning, not the actual infix operator, so this
approach can interfere with quoting, macros, and other
capabilities. Many of these past systems also created a whole new
notation which simultaneously lost Lisp&#8217;s abilities for
quoting, quasiquoting, and so on.
This proposal avoids these problems.
For example, in curly-infix,
<samp>&apos;{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b}</samp>
maps cleanly to
<samp>&apos;(+&nbsp;a&nbsp;b)</samp>,
which works as expected with all macros.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_whyisntprecedencepartofthissrfi">Why isn&#8217;t precedence part of this SRFI?</h2>
<p>Many past &ldquo;infix&rdquo; systems for Lisp build in
precedence. However, Lisp systems often process other languages,
and they may freely mix these different languages.
Thus, the same symbol may have different meanings
and precedence levels in different contexts.
The symbol might not even be defined where it is being
used, and allowing precedence definitions would create subtle errors
if files are read in a different order.
If users hook in their own precedence system into a reader, it could
even become difficult to combine code written for different precedence systems.
In short, building precedence into a
Lisp reader creates many complexities.</p>
<p>Yet the complexity of precedence systems is often unnecessary.
In practice, we&#8217;ve found that simple infix is all
that&#8217;s needed most of the time in Lisp-based languages.
Even in other languages, many developers unnecessarily use
grouping symbols with infix operators to make their order clear.
Thus, requiring grouping symbols is less of a
hardship than it might appear.</p>
<p>By intentionally <em>not</em>
building a precedence system into the reader,
a very simple yet useful infix system results.
We don&#8217;t need to register procedures, ensure that declarations
of precedence precede their use, or anything like it.
We also ensure that the notation is clearly homoiconic.</p>
<p>Instead, where precedence is desired, application and library writers
can implement precedence by defining and controlling the scope of an
&ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo; macro or procedure, or by later postprocessing
of that symbol.
Scheme macros are already quite powerful and capable of handling this;
in these cases, <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> provides a more
convenient notation.
The curly-infix approach, instead of trying to manage both infix
and precedence, handles simple cases and then
takes advantage of the existing Scheme scoping rules and macro system for
more complex cases when they are needed.</p>
<p>It would be possible to extend curly-infix to provide a full fixed
precedence system (e.g., if an expression is mixed,
attempt to use various precedence rules).
However, such capabilities would be extensions
not required by this SRFI.
See the discussion on <var>transform-mixed-infix</var>, below.</p>
<p>Note that curly-infix includes support for unary operators, but again,
they are without precedence.
As a result, they must be grouped separately.
This does not lead to hard-to-read expressions, however.
Examples of simple curly-infix lists combining infix and unary operations
include
<code>{(-&nbsp;x)&nbsp;*&nbsp;(-&nbsp;y)}</code>
and
<code>{{-&nbsp;x}&nbsp;*&nbsp;{-&nbsp;y}}</code>.
Another notation that builds on curly-infix (neoteric-expressions) can
make unary operators even easier to use.</p>
<p>At first David A. Wheeler, who started this project,
considered reporting an error if a simple infix
expression isn&#8217;t provided.
However, prepending &ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo;
is much more flexible.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_whynotautodetectinfix">Why not autodetect infix?</h2>
<p>Some past efforts tried to automatically detect infix operators,
but this turns out to not work well. It&#8217;s hard to express
good rules for detecting infix operators, and the rules become too
complex for users (e.g., &ldquo;punctuation-only symbols&rdquo;
doesn&#8217;t detect &ldquo;<var>and</var>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<var>or</var>&rdquo;).
And in
any case, if they were automatically detected, an escape mechanism
would be needed anyway. Allowing the user to expressly notate when
infix was intended, using <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>,
turns out to be far more clearer
and more intuitive. In particular, curly-infix allows the use of
infix with any symbol, whenever you want... and where it&#8217;s
not convenient, you don&#8217;t need to use it. It is also very
backwards-compatible: Normal lists work normally, and if you want
infix, use <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_whyallthosespecialcases">Why are 0, 1, and 2 parameters special?</h2>
<p>The empty curly-infix list
<samp>{}</samp> maps to <samp>()</samp>,
as it <em>is</em> an
empty list, and this is the likely user meaning (reducing
unnecessary errors).</p>
<!-- dwheeler says: I think we have to mention n-expressions and t-expressions
here, because they are part of the rationale for these semantics. -->
<p>The one and two parameter cases are defined in part to reduce user error,
and in part to better support other notations
that build on top of curly-infix-expressions (namely, neoteric-expressions and
sweet-expressions):
</p>
<ol>
<li>An &ldquo;escaping&rdquo;
<samp>{e}</samp> is mapped to <samp>e</samp>
so that the neoteric-expression
<samp>f{x}</samp> becomes the likely-intended <samp>(f x)</samp>, and to
provide an easy escape mechanism in sweet-expressions for symbols
that would otherwise have other meanings.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;unary-operation&rdquo; curly-infix list
<samp>{e&nbsp;f}</samp> maps to <samp>(e&nbsp;f)</samp>,
so that
<samp>{-&nbsp;x}</samp> maps to <samp>(-&nbsp;x)</samp>,
the likely interpretation, and also so that the neoteric-expression
<samp>f{-&nbsp;x}</samp> will map correctly to
<samp>(f&nbsp;(-&nbsp;x))</samp>.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="rationale_whatistransformmixedinfixgoodfor">What is <var>transform-mixed-infix</var> good for?</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;<var>transform-mixed-infix</var>&rdquo; procedure is not
intended for use in normal software development. Instead, it is
suggested so that a future SRFI author could more easily implement
a fixed precedence system that is built into the reader. We think
that precedence is overrated. However, if a future community
decides it wants precedence built into the reader,
<var>transform-mixed-infix</var> could be redefined to provide one. This is
only defined to help simplify implementing a plausible future SRFI;
it is not required or expected in normal use. Application software
developers should avoid redefining <var>transform-mixed-infix</var>.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_whyareinfixoperatorssurroundedbyspaces">Why must infix operators be delimited?</h2>
<p>Curly-infix requires that the infix operators be delimited (e.g., by
spaces). This is consistent with Lisp history and current practice.
Currently, in Lisp, operators are always
delimited in traditional s-expressions (typically by left
parentheses on the left, and by whitespace on the right).
It&#8217;s impractical to do otherwise today; most Lisps,
including Scheme, allow and predefine symbols that include characters (like
&ldquo;<var>-</var>&rdquo;) that are typically used for infix operators.
Many developers put space around infix operators even in languages
that don&#8217;t require them, so syntactically requiring them is no burden.
In short, it is difficult to allow infix operators
without delimiters, and the visual results are the same as many
real-world uses in other languages, so the result appears quite
customary to typical software developers.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_curlyfooconvention">Why the curly-foo convention?</h2>

<p>There needs to be a way for users to easily enable curly-infix
for the default reader (e.g., <var>read</var>), read-eval-print loop (REPL),
and loader (e.g., <var>load</var>).
We would like implementations to enable curly-infix in their normal
invocation, but some implementors may not want to do that.
Thus, if implementors choose to not enable curly-infix in their default
reader, a a conventional command line name &ldquo;<var>curly-foo</var>&rdquo;
is defined for each implementation <var>foo</var> that enables it.
</p>

<h2 id="rationale_procedures">Why the procedures enable-curly-infix and curly-infix-read?</h2>
<p>
Early drafts of this SRFI <em>required</em> support for an
&ldquo;<var>enable-curly-infix</var>&rdquo; procedure to enable
curly-infix.
But some implementations may have difficulty changing basic infrastructure
(like the reader and loader) once they have started up.
Thus, this procedure is not required, but
simply <em>may</em> be available.
This provides a simple convention for users who want to enable curly-infix,
without leaving the system, on those systems where this is sensible.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no explicit &ldquo;<var>disable-curly-infix</var>&rdquo;.
There&#8217;s no reason to disable it within this SRFI, and if some
other action changes the meaning of braces, it would be that other
action that disables it.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;<var>curly-infix-read</var>&rdquo; procedure allows reading
external curly-infix data, even if the implementation doesn&#8217;t
enable curly-infix-expressions by default.</p>
<p>By intent, this SRFI (including the enabling mechanism)
doesn&#8217;t use or interact with any module system at all
(including the R6RS and R7RS module systems). This is because some
implementations won&#8217;t have a module system (or at least not a
standard one). Curly-infix is an intentionally simple mechanism
that can be built into even trivial Scheme implementations.
Mandating module support is unnecessary and might inhibit its
adoption.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_whatabouttheracketinfixconvention">What about the Racket &ldquo;infix convention&rdquo;?</h2>
<p><a href=
"http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/Pairs__Lists__and_Racket_Syntax.html">
Racket allows a notation called the &ldquo;infix convention&rdquo;
with the form &ldquo;<code>(a . operation . b)</code>&rdquo;</a>. An
advantage of this alternative is that it does not use the braces,
so it might be easier to implement in Schemes which already define
<code>{</code>...<code>}</code> in a local extension. However, the Racket &ldquo;infix
convention&rdquo; has many problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Racket infix convention is much longer and more awkward
than curly-infix notation. In the Racket infix convention, every
infix operator adds 6 characters. Infix operations are a very
common operation, so convenience matters. An expression like
<samp>(1&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;2)</samp>
is far longer, and less convenient, than
<samp>{1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2}</samp>.</li>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t look like other languages or math. A human
notation should be maximally understandable to people given what
they already know.
The notation <samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b}</samp>
is much more similar to the standard notation
&ldquot;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&rdquot; than
<samp>(a&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;b)</samp>.</li>
<li>It is easy to make mistakes. If you forget a &ldquo;<code>.</code>&rdquo;
somewhere, you end up with the wrong result, and possibly without an
error being flagged. This notation also
makes it harder to see improper lists; improper lists are important
but rare, so it&#8217;s good to make them obvious - the Racket
infix convention makes improper lists hard to distinguish. The
Racket documentation even goes out of its way to emphasize that
infix convention use is unrelated to improper lists... which
suggests that they are easily confused.</li>
<li>Without <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>, <samp>{x}</samp> is no longer useful as an escape mechanism
for sweet-expressions (a notation that builds on curly-infix). An
alternative would be to use <samp>(. x)</samp> as an escape mechanism,
but at that point dots-in-lists become busy and confusing.</li>
<li>Racket&#8217;s implementation, according to its documentation,
does not allow multiple operations,
e.g.,
<samp>(a&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;b&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;c&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;d)</samp>.
That could be added,
but using them makes the Racket infix convention even more
unwieldy. For example, compare
<samp>(a&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;b&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;c&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;d)</samp>
to
<samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&nbsp;+&nbsp;c&nbsp;+&nbsp;d}</samp>.</li>
<li>Even Racket users don&#8217;t use this convention often. Its
documentation says that &ldquo;Racket programmers use the infix
convention sparingly&mdash;mostly for asymmetric binary operators
such as <var>&lt;</var> and <var>is-a?</var>&rdquo;.
The documentation does not say why,
but its extra length and awkwardness may be part of the reason.
In any case, the fact that the Racket documentation recommends that it
be used &ldquo;sparingly&rdquo; does not encourage wider adoption.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, cases where infix notation would be useful are
extremely common, so its notation should be convenient.
The Racket &ldquo;infix convention&rdquo; may be the
next-best notation for infix notation after curly-infix, but
it&#8217;s next-best, and we should strive for the <em>best</em>
available notation for such a common need.
Curly-infix does not <em>conflict</em> with the
Racket infix convention; implementations could implement both.
We recommend that an implementation that
implements the Racket infix convention should also allow multiple
operands and use curly-infix semantics for them, pretending that
<samp>.&nbsp;op&nbsp;.</samp>
is a single parameter.
In that case,
<samp>(a&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;b&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;c)</samp>
would map to
<samp>(+&nbsp;a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c)</samp>,
and
<samp>(a&nbsp;.&nbsp;+&nbsp;.&nbsp;b&nbsp;.&nbsp;*&nbsp;.&nbsp;c)</samp>
would map to
<samp>(nfx&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&nbsp;*&nbsp;c)</samp>.
Note that the existence of the Racket &ldquo;infix
convention&rdquo; is additional evidence of the <em>need</em> for a
standard infix convention; many have separately created mechanisms
to try to provide infix support.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_otherdetails">Other details</h2>
<p>There is no requirement that writers (e.g., &ldquo;<var>write</var>&rdquo;
or a pretty-printer) write out curly-infix expressions. They may
choose to do so, e.g., for lists of length 3-6 whose car is the
symbol &ldquo;<var>and</var>&rdquo;,
the symbol &ldquo;<var>or</var>&rdquo;, or a
punctuation-only symbol. However, it would probably be wise to wait
until many implementations can handle c-expressions.</p>
<p>Curly-infix is designed so that it can work on other Lisps as
well. We even have a working implementation in Common Lisp.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;<var>curly-foo</var>&rdquo; command convention is required so
that users can easily invoke the implementation with curly-infix
enabled to start with.</p>
<p>Note that this is the first of three tiers developed by the
&ldquo;readable&rdquo; project. We intend to later submit two more
SRFIs, to define two other tiers that build on top of
curly-infix-expressions (neoteric-expressions and
sweet-expressions). However, curly-infix-expressions are useful on
their own, even without these other notations.</p>
<p>Curly-infix is an unusually simple mechanism, but like much of
any Lisp-based language, its power comes from its simplicity.</p>

<h1 id="specification">Specification</h1>
<p>&ldquo;Curly-infix-expressions&rdquo; (c-expressions) are
s-expressions with an additional notation: The curly-infix list.
A curly-infix list is syntactically identical to a normal list,
except it is surrounded by curly braces instead of by parentheses.
Once a curly-infix list is read, it is mapped differently than a
regular list by a curly-infix reader:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <dfn>simple</dfn> curly-infix list has an odd number of
parameters, at least three parameters, and all even parameters are
&ldquo;<var>eq?</var>&rdquo; symbols. A simple curly-infix list is mapped by
the reader into a list with the even parameter followed by the odd
parameters.
E.g.,
<samp>{n&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;2}</samp>
maps to
<samp>(&lt;=&nbsp;n&nbsp;2)</samp>,
and
<samp>{2&nbsp;*&nbsp;3&nbsp;*&nbsp;4}</samp>
maps to
<samp>(*&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;4)</samp>.</li>
<li>The <dfn>empty</dfn> curly-infix list
<samp>{}</samp> is mapped to the empty list <samp>()</samp>.</li>
<li>An <dfn>escaping</dfn> curly-infix list
<samp>{e}</samp> is mapped to <samp>e</samp>.
E.g., <samp>{5}</samp> is mapped to <samp>5</samp>.</li>
<li>A <dfn>unary-operation</dfn> curly-infix list
<samp>{e1&nbsp;e2}</samp>
is mapped to
<samp>(e1&nbsp;e2)</samp>.
E.g.,
<samp>{-&nbsp;x}</samp>
maps to
<samp>(-&nbsp;x)</samp>.</li>
<li>Any other curly-infix list (including all improper lists) is
<dfn>mixed</dfn>; it is mapped to the list with the symbol
&ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo; added to its front.
E.g.,
<samp>{q&nbsp;+&nbsp;r&nbsp;*&nbsp;s}</samp>
is mapped to
<samp>(nfx&nbsp;q&nbsp;+&nbsp;r&nbsp;*&nbsp;s)</samp>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some examples of c-expressions (note all operators in curly-infix are delimited):</p>
<ul>
<li><samp>{a * {b + c}}</samp> maps to <samp>(* a (+ b c))</samp></li>
<li><samp>{x eqv? `a}</samp> maps to <samp>(eqv? x `a)</samp></li>
<li><samp>{(- a) / b}</samp> maps to <samp>(/ (- a) b)</samp></li>
<li><samp>{(f a b) + (g h)}</samp> maps to <samp>(+ (f a b) (g h))</samp></li>
<li><samp>&apos;{a + (f b) + x}</samp> maps to <samp>&apos;(+ a (f b) x)</samp></li>
<li><samp>{{a &gt; 0} and {b &gt;= 1}}</samp> maps to
<samp>(and (&gt; a 0) (&gt;= b 1))</samp></li>
</ul>

<p>A curly-infix reader is a datum reader
that can correctly read and map curly-infix-expressions.
A curly-infix reader <em>must</em>
include the braces &ldquo;<code>{</code>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<code>}</code>&rdquo; as delimiters.</p>

<p>We encourage systems to <em>always</em> have
this capability enabled, even when the optional
<var>enable-curly-infix</var> is not called and the curly-foo command
is not run.  This is not required by this SRFI.
However, if an implementation <em>foo</em> does not enable curly-infix by
default, and it is possible to invoke the implementation
from a command line via some command
&ldquo;<var>foo</var>&rdquo;, the implementation
<em>must</em> provide an alternative command &ldquo;<var>curly-foo</var>&rdquo;
(the command prefixed with &ldquo;<code>curly-</code>&rdquo;).
This command <em>must</em> enable curly-infix as if the procedure
<var>(enable-curly-infix)</var> (as defined below)
had been invoked on start-up before any
user-supplied modules or application code is loaded, and before
any REPL is engaged. Note that the procedure
<var>(enable-curly-infix)</var> is not actually required; merely its
effects are.
In addition, if the implementation is invokable as a GUI, it
<em>must</em> provide a documented means to enable curly-infix as if
<var>(enable-curly-infix)</var> was invoked.
</p>

<p>Procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementations <em>may</em> provide the procedure
<var>(curly-infix-read .  port)</var> as a curly-infix reader.</li>
<li>Implementations <em>may</em> provide the procedure
<var>(enable-curly-infix)</var>,
which, on completion, ensures that the following readers
are curly-infix-expression datum readers:
the default readers
(&ldquo;<var>read</var>&rdquo; and where appropriate
&ldquo;<var>get-datum</var>&rdquo;),
the reader used in the REPL,
and the readers used to load user-supplied code
(e.g., the reader used by &ldquo;<var>load</var>&rdquo;,
and by whatever module-loading mechanism the implementation uses).
If implemented, this procedure <em>must</em> allow users to safely invoke
<var>(enable-curly-infix)</var> repeatedly, even when curly-infix reading
is already enabled.</li>
<li>Implementations <em>may</em> provide an overrideable procedure
<var>(transform-mixed-infix lyst)</var> that can be
&ldquo;<var>set!</var>&rdquo;. This
procedure would receive a mixed curly-infix list and return a
transformation of it. By default, this function returns the
original list but with &ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo; in front.
Application developers <em>should not</em> use, define, or
redefine this function; it is merely suggested to simplify
implementation of plausible future SRFIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, by definition, this SRFI modifies lexical syntax.</p>

<h1 id="reference-implementation">Reference implementation</h1>
<p>The implementation below is portable, with the exception that
Scheme provides no standard mechanism to override
<code>{</code>...<code>}</code> in its
built-in reader. Thus, implementations will typically have a
modified reader that detects &ldquo;<code>{</code>&ldquo;, starts reading a list
until its matching &ldquo;<code>}</code>&rdquo;, and then calls <var>process-curly</var>
defined below. We recommend that implementations <em>always</em> do
this, but an implementation must at least activate this behavior
when &ldquo;<var>curly-foo</var>&rdquo; is invoked
(if invoking <var>foo</var> on the command like would invoke the
implementation without curly-infix).
This is also enabled by
<var>(enable-curly-infix)</var> if supported.</p>
<p>This reference implementation is SRFI type 2: &ldquo;A
mostly-portable solution that uses some kind of hooks provided in
some Scheme interpreter/compiler. In this case, a detailed
specification of the hooks must be included so that the SRFI is
self-contained.&rdquo;</p>
