<p>Lisp-based languages, like Scheme, are almost the only
programming languages in modern use that do not support infix
notation. Adding infix support to Scheme would eliminate a common
complaint by developers who currently choose to use other
languages.
Scheme currently reserves <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>
&ldquo;for possible future extensions to the language&rdquo;.
We propose that <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> be used
to support &ldquo;curly-infix&rdquo; notation as a homoiconic
reader abbreviation, just as
<samp>&apos;x</samp> is an abbreviation for <samp>(quote x)</samp>.
Curly-infix lists are lists whose visual presentation is in
infix order instead of prefix order.
For example,
<samp>{n &gt; 2}</samp> maps to <samp>(&gt; n 2)</samp>,
and
<samp>{a + b + c}</samp> maps to <samp>(+ a b c)</samp>.
By intent, there
is no precedence, but e.g.,
<samp>{x + {y * z}}</samp> maps cleanly to <samp>(+ x (* y z))</samp>.
Forms implying precedence have &ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo; prepended to
enable later macro processing,
e.g.,
<samp>{2 + 3 * 5}</samp> maps to <samp>(nfx 2 + 3 * 5)</samp>.</p>
<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>
<p>Lisp-based languages, like Scheme, are almost the only
programming languages in modern use that do not support infix
notation. Even some Lisp advocates, like Paul Graham, admit that
they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t find prefix math expressions
natural.&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html"
rel="nofollow">http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html</a>) Paul
Prescod has said, &ldquo;I have more faith that you could convince
the world to use Esperanto than prefix notation.&rdquo; Infix is
not going away; nearly all new programming languages also include
infix. Adding infix support to Scheme would eliminate a common
complaint by developers who currently choose to use other languages
instead.</p>
<p>Scheme currently reserves <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> &ldquo;for possible future
extensions to the language&rdquo;. We propose that
<code>{</code>...<code>}</code> be used
to
support &ldquo;curly-infix&rdquo; notation as a reader
abbreviation, just as
<samp>&apos;x</samp> is an abbreviation for <samp>(quote x)</samp>.</p>
<p>This proposal is an extremely <em>simple</em> and
<em>straightforward</em> technique for supporting infix notation.
There is no complex precedence system, all other Scheme
capabilities (including macros and quasiquoting) work unchanged,
and Scheme remains general and homoiconic. Curly-infix expressions
are just a convenient reader abbreviation for infix notation.</p>
<p>At its simplest, this SRFI provides
the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; curly-infix list that accepts ordinary
lists, merely written in a different order.
The &ldquo;simple&rdquo; curly-infix list maps
<samp>{operand-1 operator operand-2 operator operand-3 operator ...}</samp> is
<samp>(operator operand-1 operand-2 operand-3 ...)</samp> so that more than
two operands are handled cleanly,
e.g., <samp>{a + b + c}</samp> maps to <samp>(+ a b c)</samp>.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_whychangethereader">Why Change the Reader?</h2>
<p>Many previous systems have implemented &ldquo;infix&rdquo;
systems as a named macro or procedure (e.g., <var>INFIX</var>). This looks
ugly, and it does the wrong thing - the resulting list always has
<var>INFIX</var> at the beginning, not the actual infix operator, so this
approach can interfere with quoting, macros, and other
capabilities. Many of these past systems also created a whole new
notation which simultaneously lost Lisp&rsquo;s abilities for
quoting, quasiquoting, and so on. This proposal avoids these
problems. For example, in curly-infix,
<samp>&apos;{a + b}</samp> maps cleanly to <samp>&apos;(+ a b)</samp>,
which works as expected with all macros.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_whyisntprecedencepartofthissrfi">Why Isn&apos;t Precedence Part of This SRFI?</h2>
<p>Many past &ldquo;infix&rdquo; systems for Lisp build in
precedence. However, Lisp systems often process other languages,
freely mixing different languages, and thus the same symbol may
have different meanings and precedence levels in different
contexts. The symbol might not even be defined where it is being
used, and allowing precedence definitions would create subtle errors
if files are read in a different order.
By avoiding precedence, a very simple yet useful infix system
results. In practice, we&rsquo;ve found that simple infix is all
that&rsquo;s needed most of the time. By intentionally <em>not</em>
building a precedence system into the reader,
we make things amazingly simple -
we don&rsquo;t need to register procedures, decide their order, or
anything like it. It would be possible to extend this
mechanism to provide a precedence system (e.g., if an expression is
not simple, attempt to use various precedence rules), but such
capabilities would be extensions not required by this SRFI.</p>
<p>Instead, where precedence is desired, application and library writers
can implement precedence by defining and controlling the scope of an
&ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo; macro or procedure, or by later postprocessing
of that symbol, instead of having it be built into the reader.
Scheme macros are already quite powerful and capable
of handling this; in these cases, <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> provides a more
convenient notation. There are serious problems if users were
expected to be able to hook in their own precedence system as part
of the reader; there is no guarantee that their routine would be
loaded before the reader, and it would be difficult to combine code
written for different precedence systems. The curly-infix approach
instead takes advantage of the existing Scheme scoping rules.</p>
<p>At first I (David A. Wheeler) considered reporting an error
if a simple infix
expression isn&rsquo;t provided, but prepending &ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo;
is much more flexible.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_whynotautodetectinfix">Why Not Autodetect Infix?</h2>
<p>Some past efforts tried to automatically detect infix operators,
but this turns out to not work well. It&apos;s hard to express
good rules for detecting infix operators, and the rules become too
complex for users (e.g., &ldquo;punctuation-only symbols&rdquo;
doesn&rsquo;t detect &ldquo;<var>and</var>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<var>or</var>&rdquo;).
And in
any case, if they were automatically detected, an escape mechanism
would be needed anyway. Allowing the user to expressly notate when
infix was intended, using <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>,
turns out to be far more clearer
and more intuitive. In particular, curly-infix allows the use of
infix with any symbol, whenever you want... and where it&rsquo;s
not convenient, you don&rsquo;t need to use it. It is also very
backwards-compatible: Normal lists work normally, and if you want
infix, use <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_whyallthosespecialcases">Why All Those Special Cases?</h2>
<p>The empty curly-infix list
<samp>{}</samp> maps to <samp>()</samp>,
as it <em>is</em> an
empty list, and this is the likely user meaning (reducing
unnecessary errors).</p>
<!-- Should we mention n-expr and t-expr at this stage? - AmkG -->
<p>The one and two parameter cases are defined in part so that they
better support two other notations that build on top of
curly-infix-expressions (namely, neoteric-expressions and
sweet-expressions). An &ldquo;escaping&rdquo;
<samp>{e}</samp> is mapped to <samp>e</samp>
so that the neoteric-expression
<samp>f{x}</samp> becomes the likely-intended <samp>(f x)</samp>, and to
provide an easy escape mechanism in sweet-expressions for symbols
that would otherwise have other meanings.
The &ldquo;unary-operation&rdquo; curly-infix list
<samp>{e f}</samp> maps to <samp>(e f)</samp>,
so that <samp>{- x}</samp> maps to <samp>(- x)</samp>,
the likely interpretation, and also so that the neoteric-expression
<samp>f{- x}</samp> will map correctly to <samp>(f (- x))</samp>.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_whatistransformmixedinfixgoodfor">What is <var>transform-mixed-infix</var> Good For?</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;<var>transform-mixed-infix</var>&rdquo; procedure is not
intended for normal softwarew development use. Instead, it is
suggested so that a future SRFI author could more easily implement
a fixed precedence system that is built into the reader. We think
that precedence is overrated. However, if a future community
decides it wants precedence built into the reader,
<var>transform-mixed-infix</var> could be redefined to provide one. This is
only defined to help simplify implementing a plausible future SRFI;
it is not required or expected in normal use. Application software
developers should avoid redefining <var>transform-mixed-infix</var>.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_whyareinfixoperatorssurroundedbyspaces">Why Are Infix Operators Surrounded by Spaces?</h2>
<p>Curly-infix requires that infix operators be delimited (e.g., by
spaces). This is consistent with Lisp history; operators are always
delimited in traditional s-expressions (typically by left
parentheses on the left, and space on the right). It&apos;s also
impractical to do otherwise; most Lisps, including Scheme, allow
and predefine symbols that include characters (like
&ldquo;<var>-</var>&rdquo;) that are typically used for infix operators. Many
developers will put space around infix operators even in languages
that don&rsquo;t require them, so syntactically requiring them is
no burden. In short, it is difficult to allow infix operators
without delimiters, and the visual results are the same as many
real-world uses in other languages, so the result appears quite
customary to typical software developers.</p>
<!-- Shouldn't this part above be in Specifications?-->

<h2 id="rationale_whyshouldcurlyinfixalwaysbeenabled">Why Should Curly-Infix Always Be Enabled?</h2>
<p>If a reader implements this SRFI, we would like it to
<em>always</em> be enabled. However, we provide a conventional name
for an implementation to turn it on, and a
&ldquo;<var>enable-curly-infix</var>&rdquo; procedure to turn it on as well.
This way, implementors can make it optional in their
&ldquo;native&rdquo; implementation, or to switch from whatever was
their previous interpretation. By having a standard mechanism for
enabling it, we hope will encourage adoption. Users should invoke
&ldquo;<var>(enable-curly-infix)</var>&rdquo; before using curly-infix lists.
The &ldquo;<var>curly-infix-read</var>&rdquo; procedure allows reading
external curly-infix data, even if the implementation doesn&apos;t
implement it <!--"enable it in the built-in reader"--> by default.</p>
<p>By intent, this SRFI (including the enabling mechanism)
doesn&apos;t use or interact with any module system at all
(including the R6RS and R7RS module systems). This is because some
implementations won&apos;t have a module system (or at least not a
standard one). Curly-infix is an intentionally simple mechanism
that can be built into even trivial Scheme implementation.
Mandating module support is unnecessary and might inhibit its
adoption.</p>
<p>There&apos;s no explicit &ldquo;<var>disable-curly-infix</var>&rdquo;.
There&apos;s no reason to disable it within this SRFI, and if some
other action changes the meaning of braces, it would be that other
action that disables it.</p>
<p>There is no requirement that writers (e.g., &ldquo;<var>write</var>&rdquo;
or a pretty-printer) write out curly-infix expressions. They may
choose to do so, e.g., for lists of length 3-6 whose car is the
symbol &ldquo;<var>and</var>&rdquo;,
the symbol &ldquo;<var>or</var>&rdquo;,
or a
punctuation-only symbol. However, it would probably be wise to wait
until many implementations can handle c-expressions.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_whatabouttheracketinfixconvention">What About the Racket &ldquo;Infix Convention&rdquo;?</h2>
<p><a href=
"http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/Pairs__Lists__and_Racket_Syntax.html">
Racket allows a notation called the &ldquo;infix convention&rdquo;
with the form &ldquo;<code>(a . operation . b)</code>&rdquo;</a>. An
advantage of this alternative is that it does not use the braces,
so it might be easier to implement in Schemes which already define
<code>{</code>...<code>}</code> in a local extension. However, the Racket &ldquo;infix
convention&rdquo; has many problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Racket infix convention is much longer and more awkward
than curly-infix notation. In the Racket infix convention, every
infix operator adds 6 characters. Infix operations are a very
common operation, so convenience matters. An expression like
<samp>(1 . + . 2)</samp> is far longer, and less convenient, than
<samp>{1 + 2}</samp>.</li>
<li>It doesn&apos;t look like other languages or math. A human
notation should be maximally understandable to people given what
they already know. <samp>{a + b}</samp> is much more similar to standard
notation "a + b" than <samp>(a . + . b)</samp>.</li>
<li>It is easy to make mistakes. If you forget a &ldquo;<code>.</code>&rdquo;
somewhere, you end up with the wrong result, and possibly without an
error being flagged. This notation also
makes it harder to see improper lists; improper lists are important
but rare, so it&apos;s good to make them obvious - the Racket
infix convention makes improper lists hard to distinguish. The
Racket documentation even goes out of its way to emphasize that
infix convention use is unrelated to improper lists... which
suggests that they are easily confused.</li>
<li>Without <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>, <samp>{x}</samp> is no longer useful as an escape mechanism
for sweet-expressions (a notation that builds on curly-infix). An
alternative would be to use <samp>(. x)</samp> as an escape mechanism,
but at that point dots-in-lists become busy and confusing.</li>
<li>Racket&apos;s implementation does not allow multiple
operations, e.g., <samp>(a . + . b . + . c . + . d)</samp>. That could be added,
but using them makes the Racket infix convention notation even more
unwieldy. For example, compare
<samp>(a . + . b . + . c . + . d)</samp> to <samp>{a + b + c + d}</samp>.</li>
<li>Even Racket users don&apos;t use this convention often. Its
documentation says that &ldquo;Racket programmers use the infix
convention sparingly&mdash;mostly for asymmetric binary operators
such as <var>&lt;</var> and <var>is-a?</var>.&rdquo; The documentation does not say why,
but its extra length and awkwardness may be part of the
reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, infix is extremely common, so its notation should be
convenient. The Racket &ldquo;infix convention&rdquo; may be the
next-best notation for infix notation after curly-infix, but
it&apos;s next-best, and we should strive for the <em>best</em>
available notation for such a common need. Curly-infix does not
<em>conflict</em> with the Racket infix convention; implementations
could implement both. We recommend that an implementation that
implements the Racket infix convention should also allow multiple
operands and use curly-infix semantics for them, pretending that
<samp>. op .</samp> is a single parameter.
In that case,
<samp>(a . + . b . + . c)</samp> would map to <samp>(+ a b c)</samp>,
and <samp>(a . + . b . * . c)</samp> would map to <samp>(nfx a + b * c)</samp>.
Note that the existence of the Racket &ldquo;infix
convention&rdquo; is additional evidence of the <em>need</em> for a
standard infix convention; many have separately created mechanisms
to try to provide infix support.</p>

<h2 id="rationale_otherdetails">Other Details</h2>
<p>Curly-infix is designed so that it can work on other Lisps as
well. We even have a working implementation in Common Lisp.</p>
<p>Curly-infix is an unusually simple mechanism, but like much of
any Lisp-based language, its power comes from its simplicity.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;<var>curly-foo</var>&rdquo; command convention is required so
that users can easily invoke the implementation with curly-infix
enabled to start with.</p>
<p>Note that this is the first of three tiers developed by the
&ldquo;readable&rdquo; project. We intend to later submit two more
SRFIs, to define two other tiers that build on top of
curly-infix-expressions (neoteric-expressions and
sweet-expressions). However, curly-infix-expressions are useful on
their own, even without these other notations.</p>
<h1 id="specification">Specification</h1>
<p>&ldquo;Curly-infix-expressions&rdquo; (c-expressions) are
s-expressions with an additional notation: The curly-infix list. A
curly-infix list is syntactically identical to a normal list,
except it is surrounded by curly braces instead of by parentheses.
Once a curly-infix list is read, it is mapped differently than a
regular list by the reader:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <dfn>simple</dfn> curly-infix list has an odd number of
parameters, at least three parameters, and all even parameters are
&ldquo;<var>eq?</var>&rdquo; symbols. A simple curly-infix list is mapped by
the reader into a list with the even parameter followed by the odd
parameters.
E.g., <samp>{n &lt;= 2}</samp> maps to <samp>(&lt;= n 2)</samp>,
and <samp>{2 * 3 * 4}</samp> maps to <samp>(* 2 3 4)</samp>.</li>
<li>The <dfn>empty</dfn> curly-infix list
<samp>{}</samp> is mapped to the empty list <samp>()</samp>.</li>
<li>An <dfn>escaping</dfn> curly-infix list
<samp>{e}</samp> is mapped to <samp>e</samp>.</li>
<li>A <dfn>unary-operation</dfn> curly-infix list
<samp>{e1 e2}</samp> is mapped to <samp>(e1 e2)</samp>.
E.g., <samp>{- x}</samp> maps to <samp>(- x)</samp>.</li>
<li>Any other curly-infix list (including all improper lists) is
<dfn>mixed</dfn>; it is mapped to the list with the symbol
&ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo; added to its front.
E.g., <samp>{q + r * s}</samp> is mapped
to <samp>(nfx q + r * s)</samp>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A &ldquo;curly-infix-expression&rdquo; datum reader is a reader
that can correctly read and map curly-infix-expressions.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of c-expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li><samp>{a * {b + c}}</samp> maps to <samp>(* a (+ b c))</samp></li>
<li><samp>{x eqv? `a}</samp> maps to <samp>(eqv? x `a)</samp></li>
<li><samp>{(- a) / b}</samp> maps to <samp>(/ (- a) b)</samp></li>
<li><samp>{(f a b) + (g h)}</samp> maps to <samp>(+ (f a b) (g h))</samp></li>
<li><samp>&apos;{a + (f b) + x}</samp> maps to <samp>&apos;(+ a (f b) x)</samp></li>
<li><samp>{{a &gt; 0} and {b &gt;= 1}}</samp> maps to
<samp>(and (&gt; a 0) (&gt;= b 1))</samp></li>
</ul>
<p>This specification implies that the braces &ldquo;<code>{</code>&ldquo; and
&ldquo;<code>}</code>&rdquo; must be delimiters.</p>
<p>Procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementations must provide the procedure
<var>(curly-infix-read .  port)</var>
that can read a c-expression.</li>
<li>Implementations must provide the procedure
<var>(enable-curly-infix)</var>,
which enables this capability in the default reader
(&ldquo;<var>read</var>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<var>get-datum</var>&rdquo;),
the reader used in the REPL,
the reader used by &ldquo;<var>load</var>&rdquo;,
and the reader used by whatever module-loading mechanism
the implementation uses,
whether or not it was previously enabled. However, we encourage
systems to <em>always</em> have this capability enabled, even if
<var>enable-curly-infix</var> is not called.</li>
<li>Implementations may provide an overrideable procedure
<var>(transform-mixed-infix lyst)</var> that can be &ldquo;<var>set!</var>&rdquo;. This
procedure would receive a mixed curly-infix list and return a
transformation of it. By default, this function returns the
original list but with &ldquo;<var>nfx</var>&rdquo; in front; this procedure
is suggested to simplify implementation of plausible future
SRFIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an implementation <em>foo</em> does not enable curly-infix by
default, and it is possible to invoke it from a command line via
&ldquo;<var>foo</var>&rdquo;, it
<em>must</em> provide an alternative command &ldquo;<var>curly-foo</var>&rdquo;
(the command prefixed with &ldquo;<code>curly-</code>&rdquo;) that enables
curly-infix by default.</p>
<p>Note that, by definition, this SRFI modifies lexical syntax.</p>
<h1 id="reference-implementation">Reference implementation</h1>
<p>The implementation below is portable, with the exception that
Scheme provides no standard mechanism to override
<code>{</code>...<code>}</code> in its
built-in reader. Thus, implementations will typically have a
modified reader that detects &ldquo;<code>{</code>&ldquo;, starts reading a list
until its matching &ldquo;<code>}</code>&rdquo;, and then calls <var>process-curly</var>
defined below. We recommend that implementations <em>always</em> do
this, but an implementation must at least activate this behavior
when <var>(enable-curly-infix)</var> is called and when
&ldquo;<var>curly-foo</var>&rdquo; (for implementation foo) is invoked.</p>
<p>This reference implementation is SRFI type 2: &ldquo;A
mostly-portable solution that uses some kind of hooks provided in
some Scheme interpreter/compiler. In this case, a detailed
specification of the hooks must be included so that the SRFI is
self-contained.&rdquo;</p>
