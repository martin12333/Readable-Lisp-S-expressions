; NOTICE! The "unsweet" script expects Scheme-format lisp, but we
; are executing this in Common Lisp instead.  Thus, you need to stick
; to the syntax that is in common between the two lisps.

; This example is from "Lisp Script" by Gene Michael Stover
; http://cybertiggyr.com/gene/lscript/lscript.html
; Original version:
;   (defun fib (n)
;     (if (or (zerop n) (= 1 n))
;         1
;       (+ (fib (1- n)) (fib (- n 2)))))
;   (fib 10)


defun fib (n)
  if {zerop(n) or {1 = n}}
    1
    {fib{n - 1} + fib{n - 2}}

write-line "Clisp running!"

print fib(10)
