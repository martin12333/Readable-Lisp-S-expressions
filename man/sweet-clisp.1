.SH NAME
sweet-clisp \- Run clisp using sweet-expressions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ll +8
.B sweet-clisp [clisp-options] [FILE.slisp [args]]
.ll -8
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I sweet-clisp
runs the Common Lisp "clisp" implementation,
and enables "sweet-expressions" in its reader.
If given a filename, it will run that file (expressed using sweet-expressions);
a file name of "-" means the standard input.
If no file is given, then an interactive mode is enabled
(normally this means that the clisp REPL is run with readline enabled).
.PP
Note that it will execute (using clisp) each sweet-expression in turn.
If given a file, it will not normally display the results of each
expression.
If you want a result displayed, use functions that do so such as
"print", "princ", "write", and so on.
.PP
It accepts clisp-options (which begin with "-"), such as "-modern".
To execute a filename, make sure it does not begin with "-"
(e.g., prefix it with "./").
.PP
This command uses whatever version of the "readable" library that asdf finds.
You can override the usual readable library location by setting
the asdf environment variable CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY.
For example:

  CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY="$PWD" ./sweet-clisp ...

.PP
This command requires clisp, and it also requires
that asdf be set up properly for clisp.
.PP
The
.I sweet-clisp
program is primarily intended for interactive use.
If you're writing Common Lisp code in files, it is more portable
to instead create ordinary ".lisp" files, and begin them early with:

  (require "asdf")
  (asdf:load-system :readable)
  (readable:enable-sweet)

.PP
For maximum portability, you should also end each such file with:

  (readable:disable-readable)

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
An example use might be the following:

  sweet-clisp f.slisp

.PP
The file f.slisp would be executed; it might contain:

  defun fact (x)
    if {x < 1}
      1
      {x * fact{x - 1}}
  princ fact(5)

.PP
If f.slisp does contain this, then "120" should be displayed.
