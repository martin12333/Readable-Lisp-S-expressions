.SH NAME
sweet-clisp \- Run clisp using sweet-expressions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ll +8
.B sweet-clisp [FILE]
.ll -8
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I sweet-clisp
runs the Common Lisp "clisp" implementation,
but first enables "sweet-expressions".
If given a file, it will run that file (expressed using sweet-expressions);
a file name of "-" means the standard input.
If no file is given, then an interactive mode is enabled
(normally this means that the clisp REPL is run with readline enabled).
.PP
Note that it will execute (using clisp) each sweet-expression in turn.
If given a file, it will not normally display the results of each
expression.
If you want a result displayed, use functions that do so such as
"print", "princ", "write", and so on.
.PP
This command uses whatever version of the "readable" library that asdf finds.
You can override the usual readable library location by setting
the asdf environment variable CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY.
For example:

  CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY="$PWD" ./sweet-clisp ...

.PP
This command requires clisp, and it also requires
that asdf be set up properly for clisp.
The interactive mode also requires a properly-installed "expect" command.

An example use might be the following:

  defun fact (x)
    if {x < 1}
      1
      {x * fact{x - 1}}
  princ fact(5)

.PP
If f.lisp does, thenn "120" should be displayed.
