.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I diff-s-sweet
reports semantic differences (if any) of a file written
in traditional s-expression format, when compared to another
(possibly-generated) file using sweet-expression (t-expression) notation.
Sweet-expressions are a way to represent Lisp/Scheme data and programs
that adds additional abbreviations beyond those in traditional s-expressions.
Differences in ;-comment lines are not considered semantic differences.

.PP
By default, this program requires two filenames;
the first file contains Lisp/Scheme s-expressions, and
the second file contains sweet-expressions (t-expressions).
If there are no differences, there is no report, and
true (0) is returned.
If there are differences, the differences are reported as
in unified diff format, and false (non-zero) is returned.
The comparisons are performed between pretty-printed versions of these
files, so differences in comments and formatting are ignored.
The unified diff shows what it would take to turn the pretty-printed
s-expressions (shown with leading "-") into the pretty-printed
sweet-expressions (shown with leading "+").

.PP
If the "well-formatted" (-w) option is used, then all the file(s) are
presumed to be in s-expression format.
Each file is examined in turn to report which files are
not "well-formatted" with respect to sweet-expressions.
A "well-formatted" s-expression file is interpreted exactly the same way
(semantically) by a sweet-expression reader.
Most s-expression files are well-formatted, but in a few cases
an s-expression will be interpreted differently.
For example, "a(b)" is interpreted by s-expressions as 2 datums,
a and (b), while in sweet-expressions this is interpreted as the
one datum (a b).
For more details about well-formatted s-expressions, see SRFI-110.
This comparison is implemented by using "unsweeten" to interpret the
s-expression file as sweet-expressions (creating a temporary file to
compare to), and then doing a diff as described above.

.PP
If "-" is used as the name of an s-expression-file,
the standard input is read.
If no filename is used, and the "-w" option is given, the standard input
("-") is used as the source of the s-expression data.

.PP
The
.I diff-s-sweet
tool
is designed to be used to help those transitioning to sweet-expressions
or helping those who are.
You can use
.I sweeten
to transform your current s-expressions, tweak the results
in the way you want, then use
.I diff-s-sweet
to confirm that the tweaked file is semantically identical
to the original.
You can also use
.I diff-s-sweet
with the "-w" to ensure that various existing files will be
interpreted identically by a sweet-expression reader.
You can examine a large collection of s-expression files,
to see which ones are not well-formatted,
by using the options -w and -l together.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP 6
.BI -k
Keep intermediate files and report their filenames
(this can be useful for debugging).

.TP
.BI -l
Just report the s-expression filenames that are different
or not well-formatted; don't show the specific differences.

.TP
.BI -w
Report if file not is "well-formatted", and expect a list of
zero or more files in s-expression format.

.TP
.BI -P
Produce progress reports - just before each file is examined,
print stars, space, and the s-expression filename.

.TP
.BI -S
Produce summary statistics at end.  Only useful if option -w is given.

.TP
.BI -U\  n
Produce \fIn\fR lines of unified context when showing a difference.
This is useless if the -l option is given.

.SH BUGS
.PP
This program assumes that all inputs do not contain any cycles
(improper lists are okay).
.PP
It depends on guile, so most Scheme or Lisp extensions of
other implementations are not handled.
As a special case, it does specially ignore the text
"#lang ATOM" at the beginning of a line (this is a Racket extension),
but this is an exception.
.PP
Because it pretty-prints before comparing files, line numbers
of differences are unlikely to be the same as the originals.
To compenste, the default lines of unified context is larger (10 not 3).
You can use the -U option to change the amount of context.
