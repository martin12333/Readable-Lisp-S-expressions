.SH NAME
diff-s-sweet \- report differences between s-expression and t-expression files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ll +8
.B unsweeten
.ll -8
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I diff-s-sweet
reports semantic differences (if any) between two files.
The first file is in Lisp/Scheme s-expressions, and
the second file is sweet-expressions (t-expressions).
Sweet-expressions are a way to represent Lisp/Scheme data and programs
that adds additional abbreviations beyond those in traditional s-expressions.

.PP
If there are no differences, there is no report, and
true (0) is returned.
If there are differences, the differences are reported in
unified diff format.
Differences in ;-comment lines are not considered differences.

.PP
The
.I diff-s-sweet
tool
is expected to be used as part of a transition process to sweet-expressions.
Basically, use
.I sweeten
to transform your current s-expressions, tweak the results
in the way you want, then use
.I diff-s-sweet
to confirm that the tweaked file is semantically identical
to the original.
