.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I sweeten
translates Lisp/Scheme s-expressions to sweet-expressions.
It takes input from standard input, and outputs to standard output.
.PP
Sweet-expressions are a way to represent Lisp/Scheme data and programs
that adds additional abbreviations beyond those in traditional s-expressions.
Well-formatted S-expressions should work as-is, but
s-expressions are intended to be easier for humans to understand.
Unlike most past efforts to make Lisp more readable, the
s-expression approach is
.I generic
(the notation does not depend on an underlying semantic) and
.I homoiconic
(the underlying data structure is clear from the syntax).
.PP
Sweet-expressions are actually the top of three tiers of notation,
each of which builds on the previous one.
For more information, see the man page for
.IR unsweeten .

.PP
Only semicolon comments outside any datum are copied to the output.
Block comments and comments inside a datum are never copied.

.PP
Sweeten creates only one of many possible representations of its input.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The sweeten tool could be sent the following traditional s-expression:
.PP
  (define (factorial n)
    (if (<= n 1)
        1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

.PP
Sweeten might choose to represent it this way:

.PP
  define factorial(n) if({n <= 1} 1 {n * factorial({n - 1})})
