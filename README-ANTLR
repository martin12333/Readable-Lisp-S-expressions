Why did we use ANTLR?
=====================

We have used ANTLR to develop and analyze a BNF grammar for
sweet-expressions.  For example, we ensured that it's LL(1),
because that form is much easier to implement across a wide variety
of implementations (including recursive descent parsers) as
well as being very efficient.  ANTLR can detect ambiguities
(which we want to avoid where possible, and if they must occur,
we want to ensure that they are resolved in a reasonable
and deterministic way).  Currently there are no ambiguities.


ANTLR-based grammar
===================

The "sweet.g" file contains a BNF for sweet-expressions in ANTLR v3 format.
You can use the ANTLRWorks IDE to manipulate it.
It is designed to generate Java, so you need a Java compiler and a
proper CLASSPATH setting to use it.

The "easy" way to use it is to download ANTLRWorks as a ".jar" file, and
store it in this directory.

Make sure the CLASSPATH includes (1) the jar file ANTLR or ANTLRWorks and
(2) the "output" subdirectory.
In ANTLRWorks, you may want to select File/Preferences, "Compiler" tab,
and create a custom Classpath that includes these absolute directory names
(separated by ";" in Windows or ":" everywhere else).

You can generate Java class files from ANTLRWorks using
"Generate/Generate files".  Then go to the "output" subdirectory.
You need to compile and then run ("go.bat" does this for Windows;
"go" runs on Linux/Unix/Cygwin, and also does a test run).

A typical use process is:
1. Run "ANTLRWorks", e.g., "java antlrworks-*.jar"
2. Edit (and save) as you wish.
   - Run Grammar/Check Grammar to do quick checks.
   - You can use Run/Debug to debug; this can generate helpful parse trees.
3. To create an executable, select "Generate/Generate code".
   Then on command line, "cd output" and "./go"
   which will also run some tests.

External tool: ANTLRWorks
===================

The ANTLR BNF was developed using ANTLRworks version 1.4.3.
If you wish to edit or generate files from it, it is known
to work with file "antlrworks-1.4.3.jar" with the following attributes:
Bytes 3588307
MD5 9638f9b7b1b823fcaba977f06f0dd761
SHA-1 f7974cf14ac19c3aa1841ee88c6d2dcbad89af01
SHA-512 99374a96b541f09367af56bf704601204a6abb658ae9400776da15b4cae0e98674ee2a812d34ebad8a3fcfcde90087d031379ff88a3bd5acf02ddeaea924197b

ANTLRWorks 1.4.3 is available from:
http://www.antlr3.org/works/
in particular from:
http://www.antlr3.org/download/
The ANTLRWorks GUI is released under the BSD 3-clause license,
and it includes the ANTLR tool version 3.4, which is also
released under the BSD 3-clause license:

Expected warning messages
=========================

Many warning messages have been addressed or suppressed.
However, the following warning message still exists
(where the line# points to the definition of "hs"):

[18:06:22] warning(200): sweet.g:1029:11: 
Decision can match input such as "{SPACE, TAB}" using multiple alternatives: 1, 2

As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
Semantic predicates were present but were hidden by actions.
[18:06:22] warning(200): C:\cygwin\home\dwheeler\readable-code\sweet.g:1029:11: 
Decision can match input such as "{SPACE, TAB}" using multiple alternatives: 1, 2

As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
Semantic predicates were present but were hidden by actions.
