; We need hash tables for an efficient implementation.
; John Cowan on 10 April 2013 said:
; "... though not part of R7RS-small,
; SRFI 69 hash tables are fairly pervasive, because they are
; simple, have a reference implementation, and can be built on top of
; R6RS hashtables (which are standard). The only reason they aren't in
; more Schemes is that as SRFIs go, 69 is a fairly recent one. I wouldn't
; hesitate to use them."

; Here's how to import SRFI-69 in guile (for hash tables):
(use-modules (srfi srfi-69))

; For "any"
(use-modules (srfi srfi-1))

; There's no portable way to walk through other collections like records.
; Chibi has a "type" "type" procedure but isn't portable
; (and it's not in guile 1.8 at least).
; We'll leave it in, but stub it out; you can replace this with
; what your Scheme supports.  Perhaps the "large" R7RS can add support
; for walking through arbitrary collections.
