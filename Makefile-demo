# This demonstrates how to create a Makefile that can automatically
# convert .sscm (sweet-Scheme) into .scm (Scheme).
# Just put the following into your "Makefile".

UNSWEETEN = unsweeten

# You *must* set .SUFFIXES to be certain that the suffix rule will work.
# If you're using automake, instead of ".SUFFIXES:" use
# use "SUFFIXES = ..." or "SUFFIXES += ...":
.SUFFIXES: .sscm .scm

# The rule.  This is defined using the old POSIX-portable suffix rule format:
.sscm.scm:
	$(UNSWEETEN) < $< > $@
