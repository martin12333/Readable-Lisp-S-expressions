Readable Lisp S-expressions Project
===================================

This software improves the readability of Lisp S-expressions, by
implementing three tiers of additional abbreviations in S-expressions.
These tiers are (oversimplified):
1. Curly-infix-expressions (c-expressions): Lists surrounded by {...} are
   interpreted as infix notation, in a Lispy way.
2. Neoteric-expressions (n-expressions): An e(...) is interpreted as
   (e ...), an e{...} is interpreted as e({...}).
3. Sweet-expressions (t-expressions): Parentheses are deduced from indentation:
   - An indented line is a parameter of its parent.
   - Later terms on a line are parameters of the first term.
   - A line with exactly one term and no child lines is simply that term.
   - Empty lines end the previous expression. Just type ENTER ENTER
     to execute what you've typed.

Well-formatted traditional s-expressions continue to be read in normally,
so you only need to use the abbreviations when you find them useful.

For more information, see: http://readable.sourceforge.net.
In particular, see the [Tutorial], [Solution], and other pages on the wiki.

Lisp-based languages where this software can be helpful include Common Lisp,
Scheme (including guile), Emacs Lisp, Clojure, Arc, BitC, ACL2,
SUO-KIF, the GCC MiddleEndLispTranslator (MELT),
Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library (SMT-LIB), NewLisp, and ISLisp.

The tools provided here primarily handle Scheme and Common Lisp.
By default the "sweeten" and "unsweeten" tools process Schemet;
If you have Common Lisp, provide the "-C" (Common Lisp) option as documented.


Maturity
=======================

This code is *mature* and *production-ready* for Scheme, especially
guile Scheme.  It's been extensively tested, and comes with
a large regression test suite, and is based on a specially-analyzed grammar.
The intent is for Scheme implementations to use this code as a starting
point to embed the reader into their code... but the code can also be used
as a pre-processor so that you can use these notations today.

The code is *prototype-level* and *less mature* for Common Lisp.
If you're careful to stay within its limitations, it works, but the
Common Lisp capabilities are not as mature as Scheme.
Please contact us if you're interested in helping us mature
the Common Lisp implementation.

Building and Installing
=======================

This software supports the usual GNU Build System conventions.
Here are the steps, spelled out.

1. Download/Prepare to configure

You need to get the files.  You've probably done that, since you're
reading this, but here are the basics.

If you want to get the current stable version, go to:

   http://readable.sourceforge.net
   Click on "Download files", and download the current version.
   Then uncompress them; one way is via the command line:
     tar xvzf readable-*.tar.gz
     cd readable-*

If you want to get the latest developmental version, download the
files from our git code repository & prepare it to be configured:

   git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/readable/code readable-code
   cd readable-code
   git checkout develop  # The "master" branch is for final releases
   autoreconf -i

2. Configure

As usual, configure.  To accept all the defaults, installing to /usr/local:

    ./configure

If you want it to install to /usr (e.g., programs go in /usr/bin):

    ./configure --prefix=/usr

3. Build ("make") / test

Now build the code.

    make

You can optionally run the testsuite; it's a very good idea:

    make check

4. Install ("make install")

You actually don't *have* to install the software.  Just run
"./unsweeten", "./sweeten", "./sweet-guile", and it'll work.
But it's often more convenient to install.  Do this with:

    make install

The usual conventions all work (DESTDIR, VPATH builds, etc.).


ANTLR-based grammar
===================

The "sweet.g" file contains a BNF for sweet-expressions in ANTLR v3 format.
You can use the ANTLRWorks IDE to manipulate it.
It is designed to generate Java, so you need a Java compiler and a
proper CLASSPATH setting to use it.

The "easy" way to use it is to download ANTLRWorks as a ".jar" file, and
store it in this directory.

Make sure the CLASSPATH includes (1) the jar file ANTLR or ANTLRWorks and
(2) the "output" subdirectory.
In ANTLRWorks, you may want to select File/Preferences, "Compiler" tab,
and create a custom Classpath that includes these absolute directory names
(separated by ";" in Windows or ":" everywhere else).

You can generate Java class files from ANTLRWorks using
"Generate/Generate files".  Then go to the "output" subdirectory.
You need to compile and then run ("go.bat" does this for Windows;
"go" runs on Linux/Unix/Cygwin, and also does a test run).

A typical use process is:
1. Run "ANTLRWorks", e.g., "java antlrworks-*.jar"
2. Edit (and save) as you wish.
   - Run Grammar/Check Grammar to do quick checks.
   - You can use Run/Debug to debug; this can generate helpful parse trees.
3. To create an executable, select "Generate/Generate code".
   Then on command line, "cd output" and "./go"
   which will also run some tests.

Key files
=========

Some of the key files are:

## Installed:

Executables:

*   unsweeten: A filter that reads in (from stdin) a file of
    sweet-expressions, and outputs sweet-expressions.  You can use this
    in "makefiles" so that you can write files using sweet-expressions.
    MIT license.
*   sweeten: A filter that reads in s-expressions (Scheme format) from
    standard in, and generates sweet-expressions on standard out.
    This makes it much easier to transition to sweet-expressions.
    MIT license.
*   diff-s-sweet: A program that tells you if 2 files are semantically
    different.  When transitioning to sweet-expressions, run "sweeten" and
    then this tool if you want to confirm that everything's okay. MIT license.
*   neoteric-guile: Start up guile, but use neoteric-expressions to
    interact with it. MIT license.
*   sweet-guile: Start up guile, but use sweet-expressions to interact
    with it. MIT license.

Documentation:

*   README: This file.
*   solution.md: A description of the notations this project implements.
    See the project website for the current version of this.
*   tutorial.md: A tutorial.  See the project website for a
    current version of this.
*   spec-indent.txt: Detailed specification information on I-expressions,
    the basis of sweet-expressions.
*   spec-almkglor.txt: A not-so-updated specification for the
    entire sweet-expression spec, created by Alan Manuel K. Gloria.
*   sweeten.sscm: An example of code written using sweet-expressions.
    This is the original source code for "sweeten", which reads
    traditional s-expressions and writes sweet-expression versions of them.
*   "man pages"

The spec-* files need to be updated (volunteers welcome).  For now, see
"solution.md" for the real specification.

## Not Installed:

*   src/kernel.scm: An implementation of the three notation tiers
    curly-infix-read, neoteric-read, and sweet-read.  Implemented in the
    Guile dialect of Scheme; it includes hooks for other dialects.  This is
    installed into the "readable" site directory of guile. MIT license.
*   src/sweeten.sscm: The source of the "sweeten" program.  It's written
    in Scheme using sweet-expressions, so if you want to see what
    sweet-expressions look like, well, here's an example.
*   readable.cl: Formerly named "curly-infix.cl".  This is Common Lisp
    code to implement this.  On load, the reader readtable is modified
    to implement curly-infix in lists surrounded by {...}.
    The curly-infix implementation is fine and ready to go.
    There is an initial neoteric-read implementation, but it's not
    ready for full use yet (help wanted!).
    To try it out, run your implentation (e.g., clisp), then:
      (load "readable.cl")
*   SRFI-105.html - The SRFI defining curly-infix-expressions for Scheme
*   SRFI-110.html - The draft SRFI defining sweet-expressions for Scheme

Key directories
===============

src/      - Most source files
bin/      - Generated command (script) files for installation
readable/ - Guile library (generated, don't edit these)
tests/    - Test scripts and test cases

The "src/" directory holds most of the source code.
A "make" will generate files in the top dir, bin/ directory, and the
readable/ directory.  The generated files in the top directory are
scripts designed to invoke the locally-built readable library, even if
there's another one installed.

File suffixes are:
.cl    - Common Lisp
.lisp  - Common Lisp
.scm   - Scheme
.sscm  - Sweet-Scheme; Scheme written with sweet-expressions.

You can invoke the readers from your own Guile programs by doing:
  (use-modules (readable kernel))
and you can even:
  (replace-read sweet-read)

On Guile 2.0 there are occassional strangenesses in the interaction
between the module system and autocompilation - the particular
strangeness is when autocompilation is turned OFF.  If you want to
use sweet-guile or neoteric-guile, turn ON autocompilation, as
otherwise use-modules will use the default reader rather than
what you replace.


External tool: ANTLRWorks
===================

The ANTLR BNF was developed using ANTLRworks version 1.4.3.
If you wish to edit or generate files from it, it is known
to work with file "antlrworks-1.4.3.jar" with the following attributes:
Bytes 3588307
MD5 9638f9b7b1b823fcaba977f06f0dd761
