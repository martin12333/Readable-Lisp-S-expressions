This dummy file solves an odd problem when combining autoreconf + git.

Some versions of autoreconf don't automatically create an "m4" directory
when needed, and will fail if it's not there.
But git won't store an empty directory.

Putting this dummy file in the git directory ensures that autoreconf
has an "m4" directory to use.
