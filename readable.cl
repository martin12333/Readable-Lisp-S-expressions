; readable.cl
; Implements the "readable" approach for Lisp.
; On load, it turns on the curly-infix reader macro;
; {...} surrounds an infix expression, so {7 + 8} maps to (+ 7 8) on read.

; Implements an infix reader macro: {...} surrounds an infix expression.
; E.G., {2 + 3 + 4} is transformed at read time into (+ 2 3 4), and
; {2 + {3 * 4}} transforms into (+ 2 (* 3 4)).
; This is useful when you want simple yet flexible infix capabilities,
; without complications. It's also a VERY simple implementation, so there's
; less to "go wrong".  You can optionally use it in conjunction with an
; execution/compile-time macro to support precedence, if you want.
;
; This reader macro is invoked on expressions surrounded by {...}, and
; presumes that all infix operators are surrounded by whitespace.
; If the expression has (1) an odd number of parameters,
; (2) at least 3 parameters, and (3) all the even parameters are equal symbols,
; then it's "simple infix" and maps to (even-parameter odd-parameters).
; Otherwise, it's not simple, and it maps to ($nfx$ parameters).
; Thus:
;  {2 * n}       maps to (* 2 n)
;  {x eq y}      maps to (eq x y)
;  {2 + 3 + 4}   maps to (+ 2 3 4)   - chaining/fungibility works
;  {2 + {3 * 4}} maps to (+ 2 (* 3 4)) - Nesting works + keeps things simple
;  {2 + 3 * 4}   maps to ($nfx$ 2 + 3 * 4) - non-simple.
;
; If you always use simple infix expressions, e.g., by never mixing
; operators in the same list, then every list (after reading)
; will have the traditional order of operator-first. This means that simple
; infix expressions can be used inside ANY execution/compile-time macro.
; In simple infix expressions you can use ANY function name as an
; infix operator, e.g., {"hi" equal "hi"} works quite well - and you do
; not need to register any function name before you use it.
; You can nest simple infix expressions to keep each one simple, e.g.,
; {2 + {3 * 4}}.  You can nest ordinary lists too, e.g., to use
; prefix functions.  Thus {(- x) / 2} maps to (/ (- x) 2).
;
; If you want automatic precedence, define a macro named "$nfx$"
; and have it implement the precedence. Note that if another macro recurses
; into the $nfx$ expression BEFORE $nfx$ has a chance to modify its parameters,
; the other macro will see the lists in a different order than it may expect.
; Precedence is intentionally NOT handled by this reader macro,
; because it's easy to get precedence quietly wrong when using a reader macro.
; Instead, this reader macro is designed to work WITH an execution-time
; macro if that's desired.
;
; If want to avoid using an "$nfx$" macro entirely, just define the
; "$nfx$" macro as an error.
;
; Warning: if you use an "$nfx$" macro, don't have $nfx$ override the name
; of an existing function, or it will be confusing to use.  E.G., if
; "$nfx$" renames "=" as "setf", then you could have this confusing case:
; {x = 3 * 4} maps to ($nfx$ x = 3 * 4) maps to (setf x (* 3 4)), but
; {x = 3} maps to (= x 3) which is a comparison, not a value-setting operation.
; Instead, create normal functions/macros for each infix operator and just
; use them directly, e.g., use "<-" for assignment and define a macro
; to do what you want.
;
; Pros:
; * Easy to use: Can use ANY operator name as infix, WITHOUT any registration
; * Syntax makes obvious where new lists occur (no "hidden list creation")
; * Easily understood/verified implementation - less to "go wrong"
; * Works 100% trivially with execution macros, particularly if only
;   "simple" infix forms are used.
; * No precedence list that must be memorized (unless you use an "$nfx$" macro)
; * Can work with an $nfx$ macro (which COULD implement precedence) if needed
; Cons:
; * Doesn't directly support precedence (if you want that) - $nfx$ macro
;   must do that.
; * Doesn't rename functions, or give them new infix names.  You can define
;   functions/macros with traditional infix names separately, if desired.
