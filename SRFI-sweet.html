<h1><a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>
This SRFI describes a new extended syntax for Scheme, called sweet-expressions
(t-expressions), that has the same descriptive power as s-expressions
but is designed to be easier for humans to read.
The sweet-expression syntax enables the use of syntactically-meaningful
indentation to group expressions (similar to Python),
and it builds on the infix and traditional function notation defined in
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-105/">SRFI-105</a>.
Unlike nearly all past efforts to improve s-expression readability,
sweet-expressions are
general (the notation is independent from any underlying semantic)
and homoiconic (the underlying data structure is clear from the syntax).
Sweet-expressions can be used both for program and data input.
</p>
<p>
Sweet-expressions can be considered simply
a set of some additional abbreviations.
Sweet-expressions and traditionally formatted s-expressions
can be freely mixed, allowing the developer
to easily transition and maximize readability when laying out code.
For example, a sweet-expression reader would accept
<i>either</i> the sweet-expression or s-expression format shown below.
The sweet-expression notation was developed by the
&#8220;<a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net/">Readable Lisp S-expressions Project</a>&#8221;.
Here is an example:
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th>sweet-expression</th><th>s-expression</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
define factorial(n)
  if {n &lt;= 1}
    1
    {n * factorial{n - 1}}
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
(define (factorial n)
  (if (&lt;= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h1><a name="rationale">Rationale</a></h1>
<p>
Many software developers find Lisp s-expression notation inconvenient and
unpleasant to read.
In fact, the large number of parentheses required by traditional
Lisp s-expression syntax is the butt
of many jokes in the software development community.
The <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/L/LISP.html">Jargon File</a>
says that Lisp is &#8220;mythically from
&#8216;Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses&#8217;&#8221;.
<a href="http://fortunes.cat-v.org/kernelnewbies/">Linus Torvalds</a>
commented about some parentheses-rich C code,
&#8220;don&#8217;t ask me about the extraneous parenthesis.  I bet some
LISP programmer felt alone and decided to make it a bit more homey.&#8221;
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2070">
Larry Wall, the creator of Perl</a>, says that,
&#8220;Lisp has all the visual appeal of oatmeal
with fingernail clippings mixed in.
(Other than that, it&#8217;s quite a nice language.)&#8221;.
<a href="http://shriram.github.com/p4p/">Shriram Krishnamurthi</a> says,
&#8220;Racket [(a Scheme implementation)] has an excellent language design,
a great implementation, a superb programming environment, and terrific tools.
Mainstream adoption will, however, always be curtailed by the syntax.
Racket could benefit from [reducing]
the layers of parenthetical adipose that [needlessly] engird it.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Even <a href="http://paulgraham.com/popular.html">Lisp advocate
Paul Graham says</a>, regarding Lisp syntax,
&#8220;A more serious problem [in Lisp] is the diffuseness of prefix notation...
We can get rid of (or make optional) a lot of parentheses by making
indentation significant.
That&#8217;s how programmers read code anyway: when indentation says
one thing and delimiters say another, we go by the indentation.
Treating indentation as significant would eliminate this
common source of bugs as well as making programs shorter.
Sometimes infix syntax is easier to read. This is especially true for
math expressions. I&#8217;ve used Lisp my whole programming life and I still
don&#8217;t find prefix math expressions natural...
I don&#8217;t think we should be religiously opposed to introducing syntax
into Lisp, as long as it translates in a well-understood
way into underlying s-expressions.
There is already a good deal of syntax in Lisp.
It&#8217;s not necessarily bad to introduce more,
as long as no one is forced to use it.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Many new syntaxes have been invented for various Lisp dialects,
including <a href="#m-expressions">McCarthy&#8217;s
original M-expression notation for Lisp</a>.
However, nearly all of these past notations fail to be
general (i.e., the notation is independent of an underlying semantic) or
homoiconic (i.e., the underlying data structure is clear from the syntax).
We believe a Lisp-based notation <i>needs</i> to be general and homoiconic.
For example, Lisp-based languages can trivially create new semantic constructs
(e.g., with macros) or be used to process other constructs;
a Lisp notation that is not general will always lag behind and lack
the &#8220;full&#8221; power of s-expressions.
</p>

<p>
Recently, using indentation as the sole grouping constuct of a
language has become popular (in particular
with the advent of the Python programming language).
This approach solves the problem of indentation going out of sync
with the native grouping constuct of the language, and exploits
the fact that most programmers indent larger programs and expect
reasonable indentation by others.
Unfortunately, the Python syntax uses special constructs
for the various semantic
constructs of the language, and the syntaxes of file input and
interactive input differ slightly.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/">SRFI-49</a>
defined a promising indentation-sensitive syntax for Scheme.
Unfortunately,
<a href="#srfi-49">SRFI-49 had some awkward usage issues</a>,
and by itself it lacks
support for infix notation (e.g., <samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b}</samp>)
and prefix formats (e.g., <samp>f(x)</samp>).
Sweet-expressions build on and refine SRFI-49 by addressing these issues.
Real programs by different authors have been written using sweet-expressions,
demonstrating that sweet-expressions are a practical notation.
See the <a href="#design-rationale">design rationale</a> for a detailed
discussion on how and why it is designed this way.
</p>

<p>
Sweet-expressions <i>are</i> general and homoiconic,
and thus can be easily used with other constructs
such as quasiquoting and macros.
In short, if a capability can be accessed using s-expressions, then they
can be accessed using sweet-expressions.
Unlike Python, the notation is exactly the same in a REPL and a file,
so people can switch between a REPL and files without issues.
Fundamentally, sweet-expressions define a few additional abbreviations
for s-expressions, in much the same way that
<samp>&#39;x</samp> is an abbreviation for <samp>(quote&nbsp;x)</samp>.

<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="basic-specification">Basic specification</h3>

<p>&#8220;<dfn>Sweet-expressions</dfn>&#8221; (aka &#8220;<dfn>t-expressions</dfn>&#8221;) deduce parentheses from indentation.
A sweet-expression reader <em>MUST</em> interpret its input
as follows when indentation processing is active:
</p>
<ol>
<li>An indented line is a parameter of its parent.</li>
<li>Later terms on a line are parameters of the first term.</li>
<li>A line with exactly one term, and no child lines, is simply that term; multiple terms are wrapped into a list.</li>
<li>An empty line ends the expression; empty lines before expressions are ignored.</li>
<li>Terms are neoteric-expressions as defined in
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-105/">SRFI-105</a>.
Thus <samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b}</samp> maps to <samp>(+&nbsp;a&nbsp;b)</samp>,
<samp>f(...)</samp> maps to <samp>(f&nbsp;...)</samp>, and
<samp>f{...}</samp> with non-empty content
maps to <samp>(f&nbsp;{...})</samp>.</li>
<li>When reading begins, indentation processing is active, but indentation processing is disabled inside ( ), [ ], and { }, whether they are prefixed or not
(inside they&#8217;re a sequence of
whitespace-separated neoteric-expressions).</li>
</ol>

<p>
A sweet-expression reader <em>MUST</em> apply these rule clarifications:
</p>
<ol>
<li>You can indent using one or more of the indent characters,
which are space, tab, and exclamation point (!).
Indentation must be <dfn>consistent</dfn>;
if you use a tab character
to indent at a certain column position,
the next line should either have a tab character
to indent at that same column position,
or be indented less than that column position.
</li>
<li>An unescaped &#8220;;&#8221; not in a string (still) introduces comments
that end at the end of the line.</li>
<li>Lines with only a ;-comment (preceded by 0 or more indent characters)
are completely ignored - even their indentation (if any) is irrelevant.</li>
<li>A line with only indentation is an empty line.</li>
<li>An expression that starts indented enables &#8220;indented-compatibility&#8221; mode,
where indentation is completely ignored.
Instead, a sequence of white-space separated neoteric-expressions is read
until the first end of line.</li>
<li>Scheme&#8217;s <code>#;</code> datum comment comments out the next neoteric expression,
not the next sweet expression.
Datum comments ignore intervening whitespace, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.</li>
<li>Block comments (<samp>#|</samp>...<samp>|#</samp>) are removed.</li>
<li>For both datum and block comments, if they
begin immediately after the indent (if any),
the indentation at the beginning of the datum or block comment is used.
</li>
<li>
A sweet-expression reader <i>MUST</i> accept, as an
an end-of-line (EOL) sequence, either
a newline <i>or</i> a carriage return followed by newline.
A sweet-expression reader <i>SHOULD</i> also accept
a carriage return without a following newline as an end-of-line sequence.
</li>
<li>
Portable non-empty files <i>MUST</i> end with an unescaped end-of-line
sequence before the end-of-file.
A sweet-expression reader <i>MAY</i> treat non-empty files that do
not end in an unescaped
end-of-line as though an end-of-line sequence had been added.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
A sweet-expression reader <em>MUST</em> implement these
sweet-expression &#8220;advanced features&#8221;:
<ol>
<li>
The marker <code>\\</code> is specially interpreted.
If any terms precede it on the line, it is called SPLIT,
and it <em>MUST</em> be interpreted
as if it started a new line, at the current line&#8217;s indentation.
If no terms precede <code>\\</code> on the line,
it is called GROUP,
and it represents no symbol at all,
located at that indentation (GROUP is useful for lists of lists).</li>
<li>
The marker <code>$</code> (aka SUBLIST) <em>MUST</em> restart list processing.
If <code>$</code> is preceded by any terms on the line,
the right-hand-side (including its sub-blocks)
is the last parameter of the left-hand side
(of just that line).
If there&#8217;s no left-hand-side,
the right-hand-side is put in a list.
</li>
<li>
A leading traditional abbreviation
(quote, comma, backquote, or comma-at),
located after indentation,
and followed by space or tab,
<em>MUST</em> be interpreted as that operator applied to the entire sweet-expression that follows.
</li>
<li>
The markers &#8220;&lt;*&#8221; and &#8220;*&gt;&#8221; surround a
<i>collecting list</i>, and <i>MUST</i> accept
a list of 0 or more un-indented sweet-expressions.
</li>
<li>
The marker &#8220;$$$&#8221; <em>MUST</em> be reserved for future use.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The markers for the advanced sweet-expression features <em>MUST</em>
only be accepted as such when indentation processing is active,
and character sequence <em>MUST NOT</em> be considered one of those
markers if it does not begin with exactly the marker&#8217;s first character.
For example, <samp><tt>{$}</tt></samp>
<em>MUST NOT</em> be interpreted as the SUBLIST marker; instead, it
<em>MUST</em> be interpreted as the symbol <samp>$</samp>.
</p>

<p>A <dfn>sweet-expression reader</dfn> is a datum reader
that can correctly read and map sweet-expressions as defined above
(including the advanced sweet-expression features).
An implementation of this SRFI <em>MUST</em> accept
the directive <code>#!sweet</code> followed by a whitespace character
in its standard datum readers (e.g., <code>read</code> and, if applicable,
the default implementation REPL).
This directive <em>MUST</em> be consumed and considered whitespace.
After reading this directive, the reader <em>MUST</em> accept
sweet-expressions in subsequent datums read from the same port,
until some other conflicting directive is given.
Once a sweet-expression reader is enabled,
the <code>#!sweet</code> directive <i>MUST</i> be accepted and ignored.
</p>

<p>
A <code>#!curly-infix</code> <em>MUST</em> be accepted, and
<em>SHOULD</em> cause the current port to switch to SRFI-105
semantics (e.g., sweet-expression indentation processing is disabled).
A <code>#!no-sweet</code> <em>MUST</em> be accepted, and
<em>SHOULD</em> disable sweet-expression indentation processing
(it <em>MAY</em> also disable curly-infix expressions).
</p>

<p>
A sweet-expression reader <i>SHOULD</i> support
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-30/">SRFI-30
(Nested Multi-line comments)</a> (<tt>#|</tt>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<tt>|#</tt>)
and
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-62/">SRFI-62
(S-expression comments)</a> (<tt>#;</tt><var>datum</var>).
A sweet-expression reader <i>SHOULD</i> support
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-22/">SRFI-22
(Running Scheme Scripts on Unix)</a> (where #!+space ignores
to the end of the line),
<tt>#!</tt> followed by a letter as a directive
(such as <tt>#!fold-case</tt>) that is delimited by a whitespace character
or end-of-file,
and the formats
<tt>#!/</tt>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<tt>!#</tt> and
<tt>#!.</tt>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<tt>!#</tt> as multi-line non-nesting comments.
</p>

<p>
Implementations of this SRFI <em>MAY</em>
implement sweet-expressions in their datum readers by default,
even when the <code>#!sweet</code> directive is not (yet) received.
Portable applications <em>SHOULD</em> include the <code>#!sweet</code>
directive before using sweet-expressions, typically near the top of a file.
Portable applications <em>SHOULD NOT</em>
use this directive as the very first characters of a file
because they might be misinterpreted on some platforms
as an executable script header; preceding this directive with a newline
avoids this problem.
</p>

<p>
Implementations <em>MAY</em> provide the procedures
<var>sweet-read</var> as a sweet-expression reader and/or
<var>neoteric-read</var> as a neoteric-expression reader.
If provided, these procedures
<em>SHOULD</em> support an optional port parameter.
</p>

<p>
Implementations <em>SHOULD</em> enable a sweet-expression reader when
reading a file whose name ends in &#8220;.sscm&#8221; (Sweet Scheme).
Application authors <em>SHOULD</em> use the
filename extension &#8220;.sscm&#8221;
when writing portable Scheme programs using sweet-expressions.
</p>

<p>Note that, by definition, this SRFI modifies lexical syntax.</p>

<h2><a name="related-tools">Related tools</a></h2>

<p>
Implementations <em>MAY</em> provide a tool,
called an &#8220;unsweetener&#8221;,
that reads sweet-expressions and writes out s-expressions.
An unsweetener <em>SHOULD</em> specially treat
lines that begin with a semicolon
when they are not currently reading an expression (e.g., no expression has
been read, or the last expression read has been completed with a blank line).
Such a tool <em>SHOULD</em>
(when outside an expression) copy exactly
any line beginning with semicolon followed by a whitespace or semicolon.
Such a tool <em>SHOULD</em>
(when outside an expression) also
copy lines beginning with &#8220;;#&#8221; or &#8220;;!&#8221;
without the leading semicolon,
and copy lines beginning with &#8220;;_&#8221;
without either of those first two characters.
Application authors <em>SHOULD</em>
follow a semicolon in the first column with a whitespace character
or semicolon if they mean for it to be a comment.
</p>

<p>
A program editor <em>MAY</em> usefully highlight
blank lines (as they separate expressions) and lines beginning at the
left column (as these start new expressions).
We <em>RECOMMEND</em> that program editors highlight
expressions whose first line is indented,
to reduce the risk of their accidental use.
</p>

<h2><a name="bnf">Backus&#45;Naur Form (BNF)</a></h2>
<p>
The following BNF rules define sweet-expressions;
a sweet-expression reader <i>MUST</i> implement the productions
below unless otherwise noted.
The BNF is intended to capture the specification above;
in case of (unintentional)
conflict, the specification text above governs.
The BNF is an LL(1) grammar, written using
<a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR version 3</a>;
the action rules inside {...} are in Scheme syntax.
</p>

<p>
As with SRFI-49, we model input as being preprocessed and having
INDENT and DEDENT tokens inserted to represent the addition or
removal of indentation; a single end-of-line may translate to a single
EOL followed by multiple DEDENT tokens.
(The indent and dedent non-terminals just refer to INDENT and DEDENT
respectively.)
If the indentation is invalid, BADDENT is generated which is not
matched by the grammar.
</p>
<p>
A sweet-expression reader MUST support three modes: indentation processing,
enclosed (when inside pairs of parentheses, brackets, or curly braces,
recursively), and initial indent.
On initialization a sweet-expression reader MUST be
in indentation processing mode.
An initial indent <i>MUST</i> enter indentation processing mode,
which <i>MUST</i> end on an end-of-line sequence.
The markers <tt>\\</tt>, <tt>$</tt>, <tt>&lt;*</tt>, <tt>*&gt;</tt>,
and the abbreviations followed by horizontal space
<i>MUST</i> only have their
special meaning in indentation processing mode.
</p>

<p>
There are a few special non-terminals that act essentially as comments
and are used to clarify the grammar; each matches an empty sequence:
</p>
<ol>
<li>empty : Identifies an empty branch</li>
<li>same  : Emphasizes where neither indent nor dedent has occurred</li>
<li>error : Specifically identifies an error branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The error non-terminal makes it clear where a sequence is
not defined by this specification, and thus
recommends where a parser might specifically check for errors.
It also also acts as a check on the grammar itself (to help warn the
BNF developers of unintended interpretation).
Note that errors can occur elsewhere, and an implementation
MAY include an extension where an error is noted in this grammar.
</p>

<p>
The BNF productions below are intentionally written so that they can
be easily implemented using a recursive descent parser that
corresponds to the given rules.
In particular, the rules are given so that it would be easy to implement
a parser that does not consume characters unless
necessary and to not require multi-character unread-char
(this makes it easy to reuse an underlying <var>read</var> procedure).
However, no particular implementation approach is required.
Unlike the SRFI-49 BNF, this BNF makes comment and whitespace
processing explicit, to make comment and whitespace processing requirements
clear.
</p>

<p>
A sweet-expression reader <i>MUST</i> read n-expression tails greedily.
That is, if a potential tail begins with an opening parenthesis,
bracket, or brace, it <i>MUST</i> be considered a tail; otherwise,
it <i>MUST NOT</i> be considered a tail.
</p>

<p>
The BNF depends on this utility function:
</p>
<pre>
; If x is a 1-element list, return (car x), else return x
(define (monify x)
  (cond
    ((not (pair? x)) x)
    ((null? (cdr x)) (car x))
    (#t x)))
</pre>

<p>
Here is the actual BNF:

<h1><a name="design-rationale">Design Rationale</a></h1>

<p>
We have separated the design rationale from the overall rationale,
as was previously done by SRFI-26, because it is easier to
understand the design rationale after reading the specification.
It is long because we wish to describe, in some detail, why things are
done the way they are, including some helpful comparisons to other efforts.
</p>

<h2 id="basic">Basic approach</h2>
<p>
The following subsections describe the overall basic approach
that sweet-expressions take to improve s-expression readability.
</p>

<h3 id="general-and-homoiconic">General and homoiconic formats</h3>

<p>There have been a huge number of past efforts
to create readable formats for Lisp-based languages,
going all the way back to the original
<a href="#m-expressions">M-expression syntax</a>
that Lisp&#8217;s creator expected to be used when
programming.  Generally, they&#8217;ve been unsuccessful, or they end up
creating a completely different language that lacks the advantages
of Lisp-based languages.
</p>

<p>
After examining a huge number of them,
David A. Wheeler noticed a pattern: Past &#8220;readable&#8221; Lisp notations
typically failed to be <em>general</em> or <em>homoiconic</em>:
<ul>
<li>
A <em>general</em>
format is <em>independent</em> of any specific underlying semantic.
Most readability efforts focused on creating special syntax for each
language construct of an underlying language.  But since Lisp-based
languages can trivially create new semantic constructs (via macros), and
are often used to process fragments of <em>other</em> languages, these
did not work well.  It was often difficult to keep updating the parser to
match the underlying system, so the parser was always less capable than
using s-expressions... leading to abandonment of the specialized parser.
One example of this process, among many, is the
IACL2 (Infix ACL2) interface of ACL2.
Sometimes the parser
was continuously maintained, but this led to the development
of a completely new language that was less suitable for self-analysis
of program fragments and similar tasks (and thus no longer a suitable
&#8220;Lisp&#8221;).
In short, any new Lisp notation should be general.
</li>
<li>
A <em>homoiconic</em> format is a surface format in which the <em>human</em>
reader can easily determine what the underlying representation is.
It is very difficult to take advantage of Lisp capabilities, such as
macros, without a homoiconic format. Yet many past readability efforts
made it difficult to determine exactly what structures were being
created by the notation.
Typical infix notations with precedence were
especially common examples of this problem - they would quietly create
multiple lists without obvious indications that this was happening.
<a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/tdop.html">
Top Down Operator Precedence by Douglas Crockford
(2007-02-21)</a>, for example, discusses Vaughan Pratt&#8217;s &#8220;Top Down
Operator Precedence&#8221; and shows how important homoiconicity is.
He stated that &#8220;parsing techniques are not greatly valued in the
LISP community, which celebrates the Spartan denial of syntax.
There have been many attempts since LISP&#8217;s creation to give the language
a rich ALGOL-like syntax, including Pratt&#8217;s CGOL, LISP 2, MLISP, Dylan,
Interlisp&#8217;s Clisp, and McCarthy&#8217;s original
<a href="#m-expressions">M-expressions</a>.
All failed to find acceptance. That community found the correspondence between
programs and data to be much more valuable than expressive syntax.
But the mainstream programming community likes its syntax, so LISP has
never been accepted by the mainstream.&#8221;
As discussed below,
<a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Hopl2.pdf">
&#8220;The Evolution of Lisp&#8221; by Guy Steele and Richard Gabriel</a>
also stresses the importance of homoiconic notations in Lisp-based languages.
</ul>

<p>
See
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/readable/readable-s-expressions.html">http://www.dwheeler.com/readable/readable-s-expressions.html</a>
for a longer discussion on past efforts.
In any case, now that
this pattern has been identified, new notations can be devised that are
general and homoiconic - avoiding the problems of past efforts.
</p>

<p>
Sweet-expressions were <i>specifically</i> designed to be
general and homoiconic, and thus have the possibility of succeeding
where past efforts have failed.</p>


<h3 id="cant-improve">Is it impossible to improve on s-expression notation?</h3>

<p>
Some Lisp developers act as if Lisp notation descended from the gods,
and thus is impossible to improve.
The authors do not agree, and instead believe that Lisp
notation <i>can</i> be improved beyond the notation created in the 1950s.
The following is a summary of a
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/readable/wiki/Retort/">retort</a>
to those who believe Lisp notation cannot be improved, based on the
claims in the
<a href="http://www.lispniks.com/faq/faq.html">Common Lisp FAQ</a> and
<a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Hopl2.pdf">
&#8220;The Evolution of Lisp&#8221; by Guy Steele and Richard Gabriel</a>.
Below are quotes from those who argue against improvement of
s-expression notation, and our replies.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Common Lisp FAQ says that people <i>&#8220;wonder why Lisp can&#8217;t
use a more &#8216;normal&#8217; syntax.
It&#8217;s not because Lispers have never thought of the idea - indeed,
Lisp was originally intended to have a syntax much like FORTRAN...&#8221;</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is an argument for our position, not for theirs.
In other words, even Lisp&#8217;s creator (John McCarthy)
understood that directly using s-expressions for Lisp programs was undesirable.
No one argues that John McCarthy did not understand Lisp.
Since even Lisp&#8217;s creator thought traditional Lisp notation was poor,
this is strong evidence that traditional s-expression notation has problems.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Hopl2.pdf">
&#8220;The Evolution of Lisp&#8221; by Guy Steele and Richard Gabriel
(HOPL2 edition)</a> says that,
<i>&#8220;The idea of introducing Algol-like syntax into Lisp keeps popping up
and has seldom failed to create enormous controversy between those who
find the universal use of S-expressions a technical advantage (and don&#8217;t
mind the admitted relative clumsiness of S-expressions for numerical
expressions) and those who are certain that algebraic syntax is more
concise, more convenient, or even more natural...&#8221;.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that even these authors, who are advocates for s-expression notation,
admit that for numerical expressions they are clumsy.
We agree that slavishly copying Algol is not a good idea.
However, sweet-expressions do not try to create an
&#8220;Algol-like&#8221; syntax; sweet-expressions are entirely general
and not tied to a particular semantic at all.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
That paper continues,
<i>&#8220;We conjecture that Algol-style syntax has not really caught on in the
Lisp community as a whole for two reasons. First, there are not enough
special symbols to go around. When your domain of discourse is limited
to numbers or characters, there are only so many operations of interest,
and it is not difficult to assign one special character to each and
be done with it. But Lisp has a much richer domain of discourse,
and a Lisp programmer often approaches an application as yet another
exercise in language design; the style typically involves designing new
data structures and new functions to operate on them - perhaps dozens
or hundreds&#8221; and it&#8217;s just too hard to invent that many distinct
symbols (though the APL community certainly has tried). Ultimately
one must always fall back on a general function-call notation; it&#8217;s
just that Lisp programmers don&#8217;t wait until they fail.&#8221;</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a weak argument.
Practically all languages allow compound symbols made from multiple
characters, such as &gt;=; there is no shortage of symbols.
Also, nearly all programming languages have a function-call notation, but
only Lisp-based languages choose s-expressions to notate it, so
saying &#8220;we need function call notation&#8221;
do not excuse s-expressions.
You do not need legions of special syntactic constructs;
sweet-expressions allow developers to express anything that can be
expressed with s-expressions, without being tied to a particular
semantic or requiring a massive set of special symbols.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>
&#8220;Second, and
perhaps more important, Algol-style syntax makes programs look less
like the data structures used to represent them. In a culture where the
ability to manipulate representations of programs is a central paradigm,
a notation that distances the appearance of a program from the appearance
of its representation as data is not likely to be warmly received (and
this was, and is, one of the principal objections to the inclusion
of loop in Common Lisp).&#8221;
</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here Steele and Gabriel are <b>extremely</b> insightful.
Today we would say that s-expressions are &#8220;homoiconic&#8221;.
Homoiconic notations are extremely rare,
and this property (homoiconicity) is an important reason that
Lisps are still used decades after their development.
Steele and Gabriel are absolutely right; there have been many efforts
to create readable Lisp formats, and they all failed because they
did not create formats that accurately represented the programs as
data structures.
A key and distinguishing advantage of a Lisp-like language is that
you can treat code as data, and data as code.
Any notation that makes
this difficult means that you lose many of Lisp&#8217;s unique advantages.
Homoiconicity is critical if you&#8217;re going to treat a program as data.
To do so, you must be able to easily &#8220;see&#8221;
the program&#8217;s format.
If you can, you can do amazing manipulations.
</p>
<p>
But what Gabriel and Steele failed to appreciate in their paper is that
it&#8217;s possible to have a notation that is
general, homoiconic, and easier to read.
Now that we understand why past efforts failed, we can devise notations
that are general and homoiconic - and succeed!
</p>

<p>
Many people have noted that there are tools to help deal with s-expressions,
but this misses the point.
If the notation is so bad that you need tools to deal with it,
it would be better to fix the notation.
The resulting notation could be easier to read, and you could focus your
tools on solving problems that were not self-inflicted.
In particular, &#8220;stopping to see the parentheses&#8221; is a sign of a
serious problem - the placement of parentheses fundamentally affects
interpretation, and serious bugs can hide there.
</p>
<p>
Others who have used Lisp for years,
such as <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arcll1.html">Paul Graham</a>,
see s-expressions as long-winded, and advocate for the use of
&#8220;abbreviations&#8221; that can map down to an underlying s-expression notation.
Sweet-expressions take this approach.
</p>
<h3 id="why-indent">Why should indentation be syntactically relevant?</h3>

<p>
Making indentation syntactically meaningful eliminates many
parentheses, eliminating the need for humans to keep track of them.
Real Lisp programs are already indented anyway;
currently tools (like editors and pretty-printers) are used to try to
keep the indentation (used by humans) and parentheses (used by
the computers) in sync.
By making the indentation (which humans depend on)
actually used by the computer as well,
they are automatically kept in sync.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.gregslepak.com/on-lisps-readability">On
Lisp&#8217;s Readability and Parenthesis Stacking</a>
shows one of the many examples of endless closing parentheses and brackets to
close an expression, and the confusion that happens when indentation does
not match the parentheses. bhurt&#8217;s response to that article is telling:
&#8220;I&#8217;m always somewhat amazed by the claim that the parens
&#8216;just disappear&#8217;, as if this is a good thing.
Bugs live in the difference between the code in your head and the code on the
screen - and having the parens in the wrong place causes bugs.
And autoindenting isn&#8217;t the answer - I don&#8217;t want the
indenting to follow the parens, I want the parens to follow the indenting.
The indenting I can see, and can see is correct.&#8221;</p>

<p>An IDE can help keep the
indentation consistent with the parentheses, but
<a href="http://www.recursivity.com/blog/2012/10/28/ides-are-a-language-smell/">needing IDEs to use a language</a>
is considered by some a language smell.
If you need special
tools to work around problems with the notation, then the notation itself
is a problem.</p>

<p>A solution, of course, is to make the indentation
actually matter: Now you don&#8217;t need an endless march of parentheses, and
indentation can&#8217;t be confusing because it is actually used.</p>

<p>&#8220;In
praise of mandatory indentation...&#8221; notes that it can be <em>helpful</em>
to have mandatory indentation:</p>
<blockquote> <p>It hurts me to say
that something so shallow as requiring a few extra spaces can have
a bigger effect than, say, Hindley-Milner type inference.

</blockquote>

<p>Other languages,
including Python, Haskell, Occam, and Icon, use indentation to indicate
structure, so this is a proven idea.  Other recently-developed languages
like <a href="http://cobralang.com/docs/python/" rel="nofollow">Cobra</a>
(a variant of Python with strong compile-time typechecking) have
decided to use indentation too, so clearly indentation-sensitive
languages are considered useful by many.</p>

<p>
One problem with indentation as syntactically relevant is that some
transports drop leading space and tab characters.
As discussed in the
<a href="#indentation-characters">indentation characters</a> section,
we have solved this as well.
</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of
past work on indentation to represent s-expressions.
Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul Graham (developer of Arc) is known to
be an advocate of indentation for this purpose.  As noted above, <a
href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2002-January/000666.html"
rel="nofollow">Kragen Sitaker&#8217;s notes on Graham and Arc</a>
discusses how indentation can really help (in this notation,
functions with no parameters need to be surrounded by parentheses, to
distinguish them from atoms - &#8220;oh well&#8221; ).  Graham&#8217;s <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTML" rel="nofollow">RTML</a> is
implemented using Lisp, but uses indentation instead of parentheses to
define structure.  RTML is a proprietary programming language that at
least <em>was</em> used by Yahoo!&#8217;s Yahoo! Store and Yahoo! Site
hosting products (though Yahoo may have transitioning away from it).
See <a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/bbnexcerpts.txt">Paul
Graham&#8217;s comments
about the RTML language design</a> and <a
href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/ytimes/rtmlintro.pdf">
this introduction to RTML by Yahoo</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.accesscom.com/~darius/">Darius Bacon&#8217;s
&#8221;indent&#8221; file</a>, includes his own implementation of
a Python/Haskell-like syntax for Scheme using indentation in place
of parentheses, and in that file he also includes Paul D. Fernhout&#8217;s
implementation of an indentation approach.  Bacon&#8217;s syntax for indenting
uses colons in a way that is limiting (it interferes with other uses
of the colon in various Lisp-like languages).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lispin.org/">Lispin</a>
discusses a way to get S-expressions with indentation.</li>
<li><a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/srfi-49.html">Scheme
SRFI-49, I-expressions</a> - which are discussed next.
</ul>

<h3 id="srfi-49">What is the relationship between sweet-expressions and SRFI-49 (I-expressions)?</h3>

<p>The sweet-expression indentation system is based on
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/srfi-49.html">Scheme
SRFI-49 (&#8220;surfi-49&#8221;), aka I-expressions</a>.
The basic rules of SRFI-49
(I-expression) indentation are kept in sweet-expressions; these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An indented line is a parameter of its parent.</li>
<li>Later terms on a line are parameters of the first term.</li>
<li>A line with exactly one term, and no child lines,
is simply that term; multiple terms are wrapped into a list.</li>
<li>A line beginning with an abbreviation (such as <tt>&#39;</tt>),
followed by space or tab, abbreviates the rest of the expression.
</ul>

<p>These basic rules seem fairly intuitive and do not take long to learn.
We&#8217;re grateful to the SRFI-49 author for his work, and at first, we just
used SRFI-49 directly.</p>

<p>
However, SRFI-49 turned out to have problems in practice when
we tried to use it seriously.
For example,
in SRFI-49, leading blank lines could produce the empty list <tt>()</tt>
instead of being ignored,
limiting the use of blank lines and leading to easy-to-create errors.
As specified, a SRFI-49 expression would never complete
until after the next expressions&#8217;s first line was entered, making
interactive use extremely unpleasant.
Lines with just spaces and tabs would be considered different from blank
lines, creating another opportunity for difficult-to-find errors.
The symbol <tt>group</tt> is given a special meaning, which is
inconsistent with the rest of Lisp
(where only punctuation has special syntactic meanings).
The mechanism for escaping the <tt>group</tt> symbol was confusing.
There were also a number of defects in both its
specification and implementation.
</p>

<p>
Thus, based on experience and experimentation we made several
changes to it.
First, we fixed the problems listed above.
We also addressed supporting other capabilities, namely,
infix notation and allowing formats like <tt>f(x)</tt>
(see neoteric expressions as defined in SRFI-105).
We also found that certain constructs were somewhat ugly if indentation
is required, so we added sublists, split, and collecting list capabilities.
</p>

<p>
The very existence of SRFI-49 shows that others believe
there is value in using syntactically-significant indentation.
We are building on the experience of others to create what we hope
is a useful and refined notation.
</p>

<h3 id="separate-105">Why are sweet-expressions separate from curly-infix and neoteric-expressions as defined in SRFI-105?</h3>
<p>
Some Scheme users and implementers may not want indentation-sensitive
syntax, or may not want to accept any change that could change the
interpretation of a legal (though poorly-formatted) s-expression.
For those users and implementers, SRFI-105 adds
infix support and neoteric-expressions such as <tt>f(x)</tt>, but
only within curly braces {...}, which are not defined by the Scheme
specification anyway.
SRFI-105 makes it easier to describe the &#8220;leaves&#8221; of an
s-expression tree.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, sweet-expressions extend SRFI-105 by
making it easier to describe the larger
structure of an s-expression.
It does this by treating indentation (which is usually
present anyway) as syntactically relevant.
Sweet-expressions also allow neoteric-expressions
outside any curly braces.
By making sweet-expressions a separate tier,
people can adopt curly-infix if they don&#8217;t
want indentation to have a syntactic meaning
or want to ensure that <tt>f(x)</tt> is interpreted as two separate
datums (<tt>f</tt> and <tt>(x)</tt>).
</p>
<h3 id="writing-out-results">Writing out results</h3>
<p>An obvious question
is, &#8220;how do you write them out?&#8221;
After all, with these notations there is
more than one way to present expressions.</p>

<p>But no Lisp guarantees
that what it writes out is the same sequence of characters that was
written.  For example, <tt>(quote&nbsp;x)</tt>
when read might be written back
as <tt>'x</tt>, while on others, reading
<tt>'y</tt> might be printed as <tt>(quote&nbsp;y)</tt>.
Similarly, if you enter <tt>(a&nbsp;.&nbsp;(b&nbsp;.&nbsp;()))</tt>,
many Lisps will write that back as &#8220;(a&nbsp;b)&#8221;.
Nothing has fundamentally changed;
as always, you should implement your Lisp expression writer so that
it presents a format convenient to both human and machine readers.</p>

<h3 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h3>

<p>Backwards compatibility with traditional Lisp notation is helpful.
A reader that can also read traditional s-expressions, formatted
conventionally, is much easier to switch to.
</p>

<p>
The sweet-expression notation is fully backwards-compatible with
<em>well-formatted</em> Lisp s-expressions.
Thus, a user can enable sweet-expressions and continue to read and
process traditionally-formatted s-expressions as well.
If an s-expression is so badly formatted that it
would be interpreted differently, that s-expression could first be sent
through a traditional s-expression pretty-printer and have the
problem resolved.
</p>
<p>
The changes that can cause a difference in interpretation are due
to the active use of neoteric-expressions outside of {...},
unlike SRFI-105, and because of the indentation processing.
</p>
<p>
Neoteric-expressions
are compatible for &#8220;normal&#8221; formatting.
The key issue is that neoteric-expressions change
the meaning of an opening parenthesis, bracket, or brace
after a character other than whitespace or another opening character.
For example, <samp>a(b)</samp> becomes
the single expressions &#8220;(a&nbsp;b)&#8221; in sweet-expressions,
not the two expressions &#8220;a&#8221; followed later by &#8220;(b)&#8221;.
There are millions of lines of Lisp code that would never
see the difference.
So if you wrote &#8220;<samp>a(b)</samp>&#8221; expecting it to be
&#8220;<samp>a&nbsp;(b)</samp>&#8221;,
you will need to insert the space before the opening parenthesis.
We believe such s-expressions are poorly (and misleadingly) formatted
in the first place;
you should write
&#8220;<samp>a&nbsp;(b)</samp>&#8221; if you intend for these to be
two separate datums.
</p>
<p>
Sweet-expressions add
indentation processing, but since indentation is disabled inside (...),
and initial indentation also disables indentation processing,
ordinary Lisp expressions immediately disable indentation processing and
typically don&#8217;t cause issues.
In rare circumstances they can be interpreted differently:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a <em>top-level</em> expression
with more than one datum on a line <em>and</em> the line doesn&#8217;t begin
with space/tab, they will be interpreted differently.
Thus, at the topmost level, &#8220;<samp>(a)&nbsp;(b)</samp>&#8221;
on one line
is interpreted as two datums &#8220;<samp>(a)</samp>&#8221;
followed by &#8220;<samp>(b)</samp>&#8221; in traditional
Lisp, but this is a single &#8220;<samp>((a)&nbsp;(b))</samp>&#8221;
in sweet-expressions.
Note that this interpretation is also disabled by any indentation, so just
inserting a space on those rare lines where this occurs
<em>ensures</em> compatibility with the
sweet-expression indentation processing.
</li>
<li>Sweet-expressions also count &#8220;!&#8221; at the beginning of a line as
an indent character.  This rarely causes any issue, since once you
use an open parenthesis to start an expression any this meaning for
&#8220;!&#8221; is disabled.
In addition, the first character on a line other than space, tab, or
&#8220;!&#8221; also disables this interpretation on that line.
Generally, you&#8217;d have to have a symbol whose name
<em>starts</em> with &#8220;!&#8221; before any issue could come up
(such symbols are unusual), and then use them directly at the top level
to retrieve its value (which would also be unusual).</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="whitespace-indentation-comment">Whitespace, indentation, and comment handling</h2>
<p>
The following subsections describe the specific
sweet-expression constructs related to whitespace, indentation,
and comment handling, including why they are defined the way they are.
</p>

<h3 id="blank-lines">Blank lines</h3>

<p>In sweet-expressions, a blank line
always terminates a datum, once an expression has started;
if (another) expression has not started, blank lines are ignored.
That means that in a REPL,
once you&#8217;ve entered a complete expression,
&#8220;Enter Enter&#8221; will always end it.
The &#8220;blank
lines at the beginning are ignored&#8221; rule eliminates a usability problem
with the original SRFI-49 (I-expression) spec, in which two sequential
blank lines before an expression surprisingly returned ().
This was a serious usability problem.
The sample
implementation <em>did</em> end expressions on a blank line - the problem
was that the spec didn&#8217;t clearly capture this.</p>

<p>
Allowing a blank line to end an expression
represents a trade-off between REPL use and use in a file.
In a file, a top-level expression could be determined simply by noting
that the next expression began on the left column.
But this would be hideous to use in a REPL, because it would mean
that the results of an expression would only be evaluated after the
first (and possibly only) line of the next expression was entered.
(Early Pascal I/O implementations had similar problems.)
</p>
<p>
One solution is to have a special text marker that means &#8220;done&#8221;
(e.g., &#8220;.&#8221; on a line by itself), but this makes interactive use
much less pleasant, since users then have to repeatedly
type the special &#8220;end-of-expression&#8221; marker.
As <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/readable-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00916.html">
Beni Cherniavsky-Paskin observed on the readable-discuss mailing list
(2013-01-16)</a>,
&#8220;I absolutely hate SQL prompts that don&#8217;t execute until I add a ;&#8221;.
Another solution, already in sweet-expressions, is
quickly executing one-line commands by
typing an indent character first.
But users will often not know exactly how long an expression
will be until it is done, so this does not help enough.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, pressing Enter twice is quite easy (since the user&#8217;s
finger is already on Enter to press it the first time).
Thus, the blank line rule is intentionally chosen to help interactive users,
at a mild cost to non-interactive users (who then cannot use blank lines
without ending the expression).
</p>

<p>It would be possible
to have blank lines end an expression only in interactive use.
In particular, Python does this, since it
has different rules for interactive use and files.
However, this means that you couldn&#8217;t cut-and-paste files into
the REPL interpreter and use them directly.
David A. Wheeler
believes it&#8217;s important to have exactly
the same syntax in both cases in a Lisp-based system, because
in Lisp-based systems, switching between
the REPL and files is extremely common.
By making &#8220;Enter Enter&#8221; <em>always</em> end an expression,
the notation stays consistent.</p>

<p>Of course, people sometimes want to have something like
a blank line in the middle of an s-expression.
The solution is that comment-only lines using &#8220;;&#8221;
(indented or not) are completely ignored and not even considered blank lines.
That means you can use comment-only lines for the purpose
of separating sections in a single datum.
The indentation of comment-only lines is intentionally ignored;
that way, you don&#8217;t have to worry about
making sure that comment indentation matches its surroundings.
We&#8217;ve found that in practice this works very well.
In very long expressions (e.g., for a set of definitions in a library),
a collecting list can typically be used.
</p>

<p>Since a line with only indentation may look exactly identical to a
blank line, we decided to clearly state that
&#8220;a line with only indentation is an empty line&#8221;.
This eliminates some nasty usability problems that
could arise if a &#8220;blank&#8221; line was interpreted differently
if it had some whitespace in it;
a silent error like this could be hard to debug.</p>

<h3 id="trailing-hspace">Trailing horizontal spaces are ignored</h3>
<p>
It is not possible to see trailing horizontal space on most screens
and printouts.
Thus, the BNF is defined so that in most cases trailing horizontal space
is ignored
(except in special cases such as being inside a string constant).
</p>

<h3 id="indentation-characters">Indentation characters (! as indent)</h3>
<p>Some
like to use spaces to indent; others like tabs.  Python allows either,
and SRFI-49 allows either as well - you just have to be consistent.
Sweet-expressions continues this tradition, and
is defined so that people can use what they like.
The only rule is that they must be consistent; if a line is indented with
eight spaces, the next line cannot be indented with a tab.</p>

<p>One objection that people raise about mandatory indentation
is that horizontal whitespace can get lost in many transports
(HTML readers, etc.).
In addition, sometimes there are indented groups that you&#8217;d
like to highlight; traditional whitespace indentation provides no
opportunity to highlight indented groups specially.
When discussing syntax,
users on the readable-discuss mailing list started to use characters
(initially period+space) to show where indentation occurred so that they
wouldn&#8217;t get lost or to highlight them.
Eventually, the idea was hit upon that perhaps sweet-expressions
needed to support a <em>non-whitespace</em> character for indentation.
This is highly unorthodox, but at a stroke it eliminates the complaints
some have about syntactically-important indentation (because it is
lost by some transports), and it also provides an
easy way to highlight particular indented groups.</p>

<p>At first, we tried
to use period, or period+space, as the indent, as this was vaguely
similar to its use in some tables of contents.
But period has too many
other traditional meanings in Lisp-like languages, including beginning
a number (.9), beginning a symbol (...), and as a special operator to
set the cdr of a list.
Implementation of period as an indent character
is much easier if there is a way to perform two-character lookahead
(e.g., with an <code>unread-char</code> function),
but <code>unread-char</code> is not standard in Scheme R5RS,
<a href='http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Issues/iss356_w.htm'>and Common Lisp does not mandate support for two-character lookahead</a>.
Eventually the &#8220;!&#8221; was selected instead; it
practically never begins a line, and if you need it, {!...} will work.
The exclamation point is much easier to implement as an indent character,
and it is also a great character for highlighting indented groups.</p>

<h3 id="disabling-indentation-processing-with-paired-characters">Disabling
indentation processing with paired characters</h3>

<p>Indentation
processing is disabled inside (...), [ ... ], and { ... }.
This was also true
of SRFI-49, and of Python, and has wonderful side-effects:</p> <ul>
<li>Indent parsing becomes very safe to use with existing code.
Pre-existing code will almost certainly start each expression with
an opening parenthesis, disabling the indentation processing it
wasn&#8217;t expecting.</li>
<li>It makes it easy to disable indentation
processing whenever it is inconvenient.  For example, it supports
dealing with text that is very close to running off the right-hand
side, or is complex to express with indentation.</li>
<li>It is similar to what other indentation-sensitive languages do, such
as Python.</li>
<li>It is a very easy rule to explain, remember, and reason about.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that infix processing by curly-infix disables indentation
processing; in practice this doesn&#8217;t seem to be a problem.</p>

<h3 id="disabling-indentation-processing-with-an-initial-indent">Disabling
indentation processing with an initial indent</h3>

<p>Initial indentation also disables indentation processing,
which also improves backward
compatibility and makes it easy to disable indentation processing where
convenient.</p>

<p>This improves backward compatibility because a program
that uses odd formatting with a different meaning for sweet-expressions
is more likely to have initial indents.
Even if this is not
true, it&#8217;s trivially easy to add an initial indent on oddly-formatted
old files. This provides a trivial escape, making it easy to support
old files.  Then even if you have ancient code with odd formatting,
it would be likely to still &#8220;just work&#8221;
if there is any initial indentation.
We&#8217;d like this reader to be a drop-in replacement for read(),
so minimizing incompatibilities is important.</p>

<p>There is a risk that this
indentation will be accidental (e.g., a user might enter a blank line in
the middle of a routine and then start the next line indented).  However,
this is less likely to happen interactively (users can typically see
something happened immediately), and editors can easily detect and show
where surprising indentation is occurring (e.g., through highlighting),
so this risk appears to be minimal.</p>

<p>Disabling on initial indent
also deals with a subtle potential problem in implementation.
In a reader implementation, if we tried to just accept some indentation
of the first line and use it as the starting point, we create problems.
Typically readers return a whole value once that value has been
determined, and in many cases it&#8217;s tricky to store state (such as that
new indentation value) for an arbitrary port.  By disabling indentation
processing, we eliminate the need to store such state, as well as giving
users a useful tool.</p>

<p>Since this latter point isn&#8217;t obvious, here&#8217;s
a little more detailed explanation.  Obviously, to make indentation
syntactically meaningful, you need to know where an expression indents,
and where it ends. If you read in a line, and it has the same indentation
level, that should end the previous expression. If its indentation is
<em>less</em>, it should close out all the lines with deeper or equal
indentation.  But we&#8217;re trying to <em>minimize</em> the changes to the
underlying language, and in particular, we don&#8217;t want to change the &#8220;read&#8221;
interface and we&#8217;re not assuming arbitrary amounts of unread-char.
Scheme R5RS, for example, doesn&#8217;t have a standard unread-char
at all.  So let&#8217;s say you are trying to read the following:</p>
<pre>
! ! foo
! ! ! bar
! ! eggs
! ! cheese
</pre>
<p>You might expect this to
return three datums: (foo bar), eggs, and cheese. It won&#8217;t, in a typical
implementation; here&#8217;s why:
<ul>
<li>
In the first read(), it reads foo, bar, and it
consumes the indentation of &#8220;eggs&#8221; so that it can determine that another
is at the same level. It returns (foo bar).</li>
<li>In the second read(), it reads
eggs with NO indentation, because the indentation was consumed by the
first read() so it could determine when it was finished. It then reads
the indentation of cheese, which has an indentation more than zero. It
returns (eggs cheese), and we&#8217;ve consumed it all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have unlimited unread-char, there is no problem, just
unconsume characters once you&#8217;ve found the end. But many Lisps don&#8217;t have
that.</li>
<li>Read could store indentation state associated with the
port. But the user could call other routines, and a naive implementation
would read the wrong values. You&#8217;d have to re-wrap the entire I/O system
if you really wanted to be able to undo the indentation reliably. That
creates a complicated implementation that is likely to be unreliable,
and it&#8217;s lousy for performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>So for all the reasons
above, initial indent disables indentation processing for that line.</p>

<h3 id="block-comment-indent-significant">Why are the indentations of block comments and datum comments significant?</h3>
<p>
A line that starts with a <code>;</code> after
the indent is completely ignored,
including the indent of that line.
In contrast, a line that starts with
a <code>#;</code> datum comment
or a <code>#|</code> ... <code>|#</code> block comment
after a possible indent is considered
to be indented
at the position where the comment starts.
This means that
in sweet-expressions,
<code>;</code> line comments
have a subtly different semantic meaning
from datum or block comments.
</p>
<p>
These are the reasons for this difference between line comments
and datum or block comments:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
For block comments,
it would be possible to write a comment
that includes a newline,
then some more comment text,
then the <code>|#</code> terminator for block comments,
followed by ordinary datums.
We could have declared that block comments
that include newlines would have the comment-only lines deleted,
and block comments would have each character replaced with a space.
For example:
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Original</th>
<th>Could&#8217;ve mapped to (but doesn&#8217;t!)</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
foo
 #|comment #1|# bar
 #|comment #2|# quux
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
foo
                bar
                quux
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
foo
#| block
comment |# bar
           quux
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
foo
           bar
           quux
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
But what if Chinese, Japanese, or Korean double-width characters
are found?
The sensible approach would be to require
that double-width characters
be replaced with two spaces rather than one,
but this requires implementations to know those characters
and replace them differently.
It was judged to be a significant implementation overhead,
for what is essentially an edge case,
for a style that we felt
utterly defeats the clarity of indentation.
Instead, we mandate that block comments
are simply deleted outright.
</li>
<li>
Outright deleting comments
makes the meaning of the sequence
&#8220;indent, block/datum comment, space, datum&#8221;
misleading.
For example:
<pre>
foo
    bar
    #| ...
|#  quux
</pre>
A simple &#8220;outright delete&#8221; would yield:
<pre>
foo
    bar
      quux
</pre>
This is arguably a misleading translation.
</li>
<li>
Further, our expected use case for block comments would 
look like this:
<pre>
define foo(x)
  #|
   | First, bar the x.
   | Then quux it so that x is no longer xuuq-able
   |#
  bar x
  quux x #| Need to quux here
          | to prevent conflicting with
          | the bar table
          |#
</pre>
Again, a simple &#8220;outright delete&#8221;
would yield an empty line
right after the &#8220;<code>define foo(x)</code>&#8221; line.
Instead, what we mandate is that,
if a block or datum comment immediately follows indentation,
it is deleted outright,
and replaced with GROUP/SPLIT (<code>\\</code>).
Block or datum comments that do not follow indentation
are simply deleted without being replaced with anything:
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Original</th><th>Maps to</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
define foo(x)
  #|
   | standalone comment
   |#
  #| pre-comment |# bar #| in-comment |# quux
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
define foo(x)
  \\
  \\ bar  quux
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Although the reasons above pertain mostly to block comments,
datum comments (<code>#;</code>) are considered
essentially identical to block comments.
</p>
<p>
We could have mandated a different behavior between datum
and block comments.
But it is helpful to review the <em>reason</em>
for the existence of datum comments.
There are two major use cases:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
To just comment out a single, short item from a list.
<pre>(foo bar #;quux meow)</pre>
</li>
<li>
To easily remove the last item of a multi-line list,
where that item is itself several lines:
<pre>
(define (foo x)
  (if (not (foo-able? x))
    (error "Cannot foo the " x)
    (begin
      (en-bar x)
      ; quuxing is currently buggy; dwheeler to fix
      #;(quux
        (barred-form x)
        (co-barred-form x)
        (de-xuuqed x)))))
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
For the last case, while typically a muli-line list
is commented out by using <code>;</code> line comments,
in standard s-expression syntax all closing parentheses
are &#8220;piled on&#8221; to the last line.
Using just <code>;</code> would also comment out
the closing parentheses of
<code>begin</code>, <code>if</code>, and <code>define</code>.
</p>
<p>
But with sweet-expressions,
there are no explicit closing parentheses.
In sweet-expression form, using line comments suffices:
</p>
<pre>
define foo(x)
  if not(foo-able?(x))
    error "Cannot foo the " x
    begin
      en-bar x
      ; quuxing is currently buggy; dwheeler to fix
      ;;quux
      ;;  barred-form x
      ;;  co-barred-form x
      ;;  de-xuuqed x
</pre>
<p>
Thus, the expected use case of datum comments
in sweet-expressions
is limited to the first case,
i.e. commenting-out a single short item.
</p>
<p>
Since this first case can be handled sufficiently well
by having datum comments
take on the same behavior as block comments
(i.e. delete outright, if at start of line after
indent replace with <code>\\</code>)
then it was considered simpler
to just use the same behavior for both.
</p>

<h3 id="eof">End-of-file (EOF) handling</h3>
<p>
Non-empty files must end with an end-of-line sequence, before any
end-of-file (EOF) marker, to be portable sweet-expression files.
This limitation greatly simplifies the
specification and implementation of a sweet-expression reader,
without limiting the data that sweet-expressions can represent.
In practice, text editors normally create such files anyway, so
this is not a serious limitation.
</p>
<p>
This requirement is not unique to sweet-expressions.
For example, several versions of the C language standard say
&#8220;A source file that is not empty shall end in a new-line character,
which shall not be immediately preceded by a backslash character&#8221;
(section 2.1.1.2 of the ANSI C 1989 standard and
section 5.1.1.2 of the ISO C 1999 standard).
</p>
<p>
Sweet-expression reader implementations are free to warn about files
that fail to meet this requirement.
Sweet-expression reader implementations are also free to support files
that do not meet this limitation.
The sample reader accepts, in most cases, files that end without
a preceding end-of-line sequence.
</p>


<h3 id="semicolon">Special semicolon values for an unsweetener</h3>

<p>
As described in the specification,
a tool (called an &#8220;unsweetener&#8221;)
that reads sweet-expressions and writes out
s-expressions <em>SHOULD</em> specially treat certain lines
that begin with semicolons.
</p>

<p>
The initial-semicolon rules for &#8220;;&#8221; followed by space or semicolon
are given so that some comments - particularly
the ones about major new components -
are likely to be included in a translation from sweet-expressions to
s-expressions (namely, any comments that precede an expression).
This can greatly simplify examining the generated s-expression.
The rules about &#8220;;#&#8221;, &#8220;;!&#8221;, and &#8220;;_&#8221;
make it easier to write shell scripts and similar constructs
with embedded sweet-expressions; these
lines can invoke some Scheme interpreter, possibly via a shell.
</p>

<p>
This text is limited to only apply to lines outside of any sweet-expression.
This is intentional, because this makes it easy to implement
an unsweetener on top of an existing existing sweet-expression reader.
The top-level unsweetener
tool can simply see if a line begins with semicolon, and if
it does, handle it specially;
if it starts with an end-of-line, it can just copy it, and
if a line starts with any other character it can call the sweet-expression
reader to handle it.
There is no requirement to copy block comments, or comments inside
a sweet-expression datum, because this would be much more complicated to do;
handling block comments is non-trivial functionality that a sweet-expression
reader must perform, and there is no standard way to return comments
inside a datum.
Semicolon comments immediately after a datum need not be copied or
processed specially, because a sweet-expression reader
has to consume them to see if it&#8217;s reached the end of the datum.
A Scheme implementation with unlimited unread could do more with relative ease,
but since many Scheme implementations do not have unlimited unread, these
limitations make implementation of such tools much simpler.
</p>

<p>
These rules are based on the <i>unsweeten</i> tool.
</p>

<h2 id="specific-constructs">Other specific sweet-expression constructs</h2>
<p>
The following subsections describe other specific
sweet-expression constructs, including why they are defined the
way they are.
</p>

<h3 id="grouping-and-splitting">Grouping and splitting (\\)</h3>
<p>SFRI-49
had a mechanism for defining lists of lists,
using the symbol &#8220;group&#8221;.
This was a valuable contribution, since there needs to be <em>some</em>
way to show lists of lists.
</p>
<p>
But after use, it was determined that having
an alphabetic symbol being used to indicate a special abbreviation was
a mistake.
All other syntactically-special abbreviations in Lisp are
written using punctuation; having one that was not was confusing.
This symbol is still called the GROUP symbol,
and happens at the start of a line (after indentation)... it is
just now respelled as \\.</p>
<p>
For example, this GROUP symbol
makes it easy to handle multiple variables in a
<tt>let</tt> expression:
</p>
<pre>
let*
  \\
    variable1 my(value1)
    variable2 my(value2)
  do-stuff1 variable1
  do-stuff2 variable1 variable2
</pre>

<p>A different problem is that sometimes you&#8217;d
like to have a set of parameters,
where they are at the &#8220;same level&#8221; but
writing them as indented parameters takes up too much vertical space.
An obvious example is keywords in various Lisps; having to write this
is painful:
</p>
<pre>
foo
  keyword1:
  parameter1
  keyword2:
  parameter2
  ....
</pre>
<p>
David A. Wheeler created an early splicing proposal.
After much discussion, to solve the latter problem, the SPLIT symbol was created, so that you could do:
</p>
<pre>
foo
  keyword1: \\ parameter1
  keyword2: \\ parameter2
  ....
</pre>

<p>
Or, equivalently:
</p>
<pre>
foo
  keyword1:
  \\   parameter1
  keyword2:
  \\   parameter2
</pre>

<p>At first the symbol \ was used for SPLIT, but this
would cause serious problem on Lisps that supported slashification.
After long discussion, the symbol \\ was decided on for both; although
the number of characters in the underlying symbol could vary (depending on
whether or not slashification was used), this was irrelevant and seemed to
work everywhere.  By using the same symbol for both GROUP and SPLIT, we
reduced the number of different symbols that users needed to escape.</p>

<p>We dropped the SRFI-49 method for escaping the symbol by repeating
it (group group); the {} escape mechanism is more regular, and
makes it far more obvious that some special escape is going on.</p>

<h3 id="initial-group-mean-nothing">Why does initial \\ mean nothing
if there are datums afterwards on the same line?</h3>
<p>Since &#8220;let&#8221; occurs in many programs,
it would have been possible to define \\ to allow this:</p>
<pre>
let
! \\ var1 $ bar x
! !  var2 $ quux x
! nitz var1 var2
</pre>
<p>
We discussed this, but after long discussion we decided on a defined semantic that means that &#8220;\\&#8221; is an empty symbol, making that expression exactly the same as:
</p>
<pre>
let
! var1 $ bar x
! !  var2 $ quux x
! nitz var1 var2
</pre>

<p>We did this
intentionally.  It turns out that there are situations where you want a \\
as an empty symbol, even when text follows it on the line.  An example is
arc&#8217;s if-then-else, where there are <em>logically</em> pairs of items,
but from a <em>list</em> semantic are at the same level. E.G.:</p>
<pre>
if
! condition1()
! \\ action1()
! condition2()
! \\ action2()
! \\ otherwise-action()
</pre>
<p>
For a more Scheme-centric viewpoint,
some Scheme implementations use keyword objects.
For example, in Guile, module declarations look like:
</p>
<pre>
define-module
! \\ amkg cat meow
! #:use-module
! \\ amkg dog woof
! #:export
! \\ (meow hiss)
</pre>

<p>
Also, the collecting list notation (&lt;*...*&gt;) handles short
let variable assignment in a more graceful way, so there was no
strong reason to use the first semantic while many good reasons to
choose the semantic actually chosen.
</p>


<h3 id="traditional-abbreviations">Traditional abbreviations</h3>

<p>As with SRFI-49, a leading traditional
abbreviation (quote, comma, backquote, or comma-at) right after any indent,
and followed by space or tab, is that operator
applied to the sweet-expression starting at the same line.
For example, a complex indented structure can be
quoted simply by prefixing a single quote and space.
This makes it easy to abbreviations to complex indented structures.
An abbrevation alone on a line (after indentation), followed by
an indented expression, applies that abbreviation to the expression;
this seems to be what &#8220;users expect&#8221;, and supporting it
eliminates a potential source of confusion.
</p>

<h3 id="sublist">Sublist ($)</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/readable-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00401.html">
On 2012-07-18, Alan Manuel Gloria
noted that certain constructs were common and annoying to express</a>,
e.g., <samp>first(second(third(fourth)))</samp>,
and based on Haskell experience,
suggested being able to write them as
<samp>first $ second $ third(fourth)</samp>.
Again, the idea is that this is an abbreviation for a common-enough
practice.</p>

<p>This is another example (like GROUP/SPLIT) of a
construct that, when you need it, is incredibly useful.
It&#8217;s not
all that unusual to have a few processing or cleanup functions that
take a single argument, and for all the &#8220;real work&#8221; to be nested
in something else.
This would require several levels of indentation
without sublist, but they are easily handled with sublist.
</p>
<p>
An example is
scsh, which has functions like &#8220;run&#8221; that are applied to
another list.
With sublist, this is easily expressed.
For example, here&#8217;s a sweet-expression using scsh:
</p>
<pre>
  run $ grep -v "xx.*zz" &lt;(oldfile) &gt;(newfile)
</pre>

<p>
(Oh, and a brief aside: in fully compliant Schemes,
"-i" is the negated square root of 1.
That means that any "-i" option should be specially escaped
in a fully-compliant Scheme.
That odd special case has nothing to do with sweet-expressions,
but we thought you should know about that.)
</p>
<p>
(And another brief aside: technically,
RnRS do not allow symbols to start with "-" for that matter
(it's not in the set of defined <code>&lt;initial&gt;</code>),
although many actual Schemes in practice support such symbols)
</p>

<p>SUBLIST also makes certain idioms possible.
For instance,
some functions need to change their behavior
based on the type of the inputs.
Here&#8217;s an example, a definition that could take advantage of
SRFI-105&#8217;s <var>$bracket-apply$</var>:
</p>

<pre>
define c[i]
  cond
    vector?(c)
      vector-ref c i
    string?(c)
      string-ref c i
    pair?(c)
      list-ref c i
    else
      error "Not a collection"
</pre>

<p>
This function shows a common occurrence
in Scheme programming:
A function that immediately begins with <code>cond</code>.
The formatting of <code>cond</code> above, however,
has several lines that consist of a single n-expression item
(e.g. &#8220;<code>cond</code>&#8221;, &#8220;<code>else</code>&#8221;,
&#8220;<code>string?(c)</code>&#8221;, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Vertical space is precious.
Using SUBLIST,
we can compress the code to:
</p>

<pre>
define c[i] $ cond
  vector?(c) $ vector-ref c i
  string?(c) $ string-ref c i
  pair?(c)   $ list-ref c i
  else       $ error "Not a collection"
</pre>

<p>
Arguably,
this can be done by putting the <code>cond</code> branches
in explicit parentheses.
However, the idiom supported by SUBLIST is more general
than explicit parentheses can be,
because SUBLIST does not disable indentation processing.
In particular,
this idiomatic formatting of <code>cond</code> using SUBLIST
makes possible the following code:
</p>

<pre>
define merge(&lt; as bs) $ cond
  null?(as)           $ bs
  null?(bs)           $ as
  {car(as) &lt; car(bs)} $ cons
                         car as
                         merge &lt; (cdr as) bs
  else                $ cons
                         car bs
                         merge &lt; as (cdr bs)
</pre>

<p>
Without SUBLIST, the more complex branches of the <code>cond</code>
would have to be formatted differently from the simpler branches
(unless you are willing to waste a line to write just &#8220;<code>as</code>&#8221;),
or would be expressed in deeply-nested parentheses,
defeating the purpose of using sweet-expressions.
</p>

<p>After discussion,
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/readable-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00496.html">
SUBLIST was accepted in 2012-07-23</a>.</p>

<h3 id="single-item-sublist">Why is <code>a $ b</code> equivalent to <code>(a b)</code> rather than <code>(a (b))</code>?</h3>

<p>
When initially learning SUBLIST,
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/readable-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00562.html">
some people assume that &#8220;a $ b&#8221; should map to &#8220;(a (b))&#8221;</a>.
However, the specification specifically does not
yield this semantic; &#8220;a $ b&#8221; maps to &#8220;(a b)&#8221;.
At first, some people think that this is an inconsistency.
</p>
<p>
However, this is actually more consistent and produces better results.
SUBLIST (<code>$</code>) does not imply
that the succeeding text should be a list;
instead, it denotes that the succeeding text
is the <i>last argument</i> of the current line.
</p>
<p>
More concretely, consider this code:
</p>
<pre>
a
  b
    c
      d
</pre>
<p>
The sub-list starting with <code>b</code>
is the last (and only) argument of <code>a</code>,
the sub-list starting with <code>c</codE>
is the last (and only) argument of <code>b</code>,
and so on.
</p>
<p>
SUBLIST allows us to compress this text
into a shorter form:
</p>
<pre>
a $ b
  c
    d
</pre>
<p>
We can repeat this:
</p>
<pre>
a $ b $ c
  d
</pre>
<p>
However, if <code>a $ b</code> is
<code>(a (b))</code>,
we need to stop at this point,
because:
</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><th>Original</th><th>Maps to:</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<pre>
a
  b
</pre></td><td><pre>
(a
  b)
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Since outside of SUBLIST,
we consistently map a singleton datum
as that datum by itself,
SUBLIST also consistently maps a singleton datum
as that datum by itself.
</p>
<p>
By selecting this behavior,
the example above
can be expressed as:
</p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr><th>Original</th><th>Equivalent to:</th><th>Maps to:</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>
a
  b
    c
      d
</pre></td>
<td><pre>a $ b $ c $ d</pre></td>
<td><pre>(a (b (c d)))</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
This consistency is desirable;
let&#8217;s review the <code>merge</code> example
from the previous question:
</p>
<pre>
define merge(&lt; as bs) $ cond
  null?(as)           $ bs
  null?(bs)           $ as
  {car(as) &lt; car(bs)} $ cons
                         car as
                         merge &lt; (cdr as) bs
  else                $ cons
                         car bs
                         merge &lt; as (cdr bs)
</pre>
<p>
We can adopt a coding style
where the condition and the branch code
in a <code>cond</code> expression
is separated consistently by a SUBLIST character.
This consistency is impossible
if SUBLIST always created a list
even in the case that the right-hand side
is a single datum.
</p>

<h3 id="collecting-lists">Collecting lists (&lt;* ... *&gt;)</h3>
<p>
Sweet-expressions without collecting lists (&lt;* ... *&gt;)
work well in a vast number of circumstances.
However, they can be somewhat awkward for two use cases:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A long sequence of definitions contained within an initial statement.
This situation occurs in many library definition structures such as
Scheme R7RS <tt>define-library</tt> and in some larger data structures.</li>
<li>A let-style statement with one or two variables
with short initial values.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Let&#8217;s begin with the first use case.
When there is a long sequence of definitions contained within an
initial statement, and no special notation like collecting lists,
all the definitions in the long sequence must be
indented and none can be separated by a blank line
(since that would end the entire sequence, not just a definition).
Indenting almost an entire file is annoying, and needing no blank lines
for that long invites mistakes.
</p>

<p>
For example, here&#8217;s an example from the R7RS Scheme specification
for define-library:
</p>
<pre>
(define-library
  (example grid)
  (export make rows cols ref each (rename put! set!))
  (import (scheme base))
  (begin
    (define (make n m)
      (let ((grid (make-vector n)))
        (do ((i 0 (+ i 1)))
            ((= i n) grid)
          (let ((v (make-vector m #f alse)))
            (vector-set! grid i v)))))
    (define (rows grid) (vector-length grid))
    (define (cols grid)
      (vector-length (vector-ref grid 0)))
    (define (ref grid n m)
      (and (&lt; -1 n (rows grid))
           (&lt; -1 m (cols grid))
           (vector-ref (vector-ref grid n) m)))
    (define (put! grid n m v)
      (vector-set! (vector-ref grid n) m v))))
</pre>
<p>
This is easily reformatted into this sweet-expression, but
notice the long sequence of indented definitions that, if long,
loses a lot of horizontal space and can invite mistakes:
</p>
<pre>
define-library
  example grid
  export make rows cols ref each rename(put! set!)
  import scheme(base)
  begin
    define make(n m)
      let (grid(make-vector(n)))
        do (i(0 {i + 1}))
        ! {i = n} grid
        ! let (v(make-vector(m #f alse))) vector-set!(grid i v)
    define rows(grid) vector-length(grid)
    define cols(grid) vector-length(vector-ref(grid 0))
    define ref(grid n m)
      and
        {-1 &lt; n &lt; rows(grid)}
        {-1 &lt; m &lt; cols(grid)}
        vector-ref vector-ref(grid n) m
    define put!(grid n m v) vector-set!(vector-ref(grid n) m v)
</pre>

<p>
But wholesale changes to sweet-expressions do not seem warranted
for this special case, because
there are reasons that sweet-expressions are defined the way they are.
It is fundamental that a child line is indented from its parent, since
that is the point of indentation.
Opening a parentheses intentionally disables indentation processing;
this is what developers typically expect (note that both Python and
SRFI-49 do this), and it also makes sweet-expressions very
backwards-compatible with traditional s-expressions.
Ending a definition at a blank line is very convenient for interactive use,
and interactive and file notation should be identical
(since people often switch between them).
</p>

<p>
Now let&#8217;s look at the second use case.
The sweet-expression notation cleanly handles cases where let-expression
variables have complex values (e.g., using \\), but for simple cases
(1-2 variables having short initial values)
it can take up more vertical space than traditional formatting.
Using a leading &#8220;$&#8221; takes up somewhat less vertical space, but it still
takes up an additional line for a trivial case, it does not work
the same way for let expressions with 2 variables,
and David A. Wheeler thinks it is a rather unclear construction.
In particular, you cannot use
&#8220;$&nbsp;x&nbsp;5&nbsp;$&nbsp;y&nbsp;7&#8221;
for a two-variable let statement; that would
map to
<code>((x&nbsp;5&nbsp;(y&nbsp;7)))</code>,
not
<code>((x&nbsp;5)&nbsp;(y&nbsp;7))</code>.
You can also use parenthetical notation directly, but this is
relatively ugly and it is annoying to need to do this for a common case.
A similar argument applies to do-expressions, and these are
not at all unusual in Scheme code:
</p>
<pre>
let  ; Using \\ takes up a lot of vertical space in simple cases
  \\
    x 5
  {x + x}

let
  \\
    x 5
    y 7
  {x + x}

let  ; Less vertical space, but works for 1 variable only
  $ x 5
  {x + 5}

; The two-variable format can be surprising and does not let the
; programmer emphasize the special nature of the variable assignments
; (compared to the later expressions in a let statement).
let
  x(5) y(7)
  {x + 5}

let (x(5)) ; Use parentheses
  {x + x}
let (x(5) y(7))
  {x + x}
</pre>

<p>
A <i>collecting list</i> is surrounded by the markers &lt;* and *&gt;.
The &lt;* and *&gt; represent opening and closing
parentheses, but restart indentation processing
at the beginning instead of disabling indentation processing,
and collect any sweet-expressions inside.
The purpose of collecting lists is to make it easy to clearly
express these and similar use cases.
</p>

<p>
In a collecting list, horizontal spaces after the initial &lt;*
are consumed, and then sweet-expressions are read.
These t-expressions must not be indented (though you can indent
lines with only ;-comments).
</p>

<p>
Here an example of using collecting lists for the library structure above:
</p>
<pre>
define-library
  example grid
  export make rows cols ref each rename(put! set!)
  import scheme(base)
  &lt;* begin

define make(n m)
  let (grid(make-vector(n)))
    do (i(0 {i + 1}))
    ! {i = n} grid
    ! let (v(make-vector(m #f alse))) vector-set!(grid i v)

define rows(grid) vector-length(grid)
define cols(grid) vector-length(vector-ref(grid 0))

define ref(grid n m)
  and
    {-1 &lt; n &lt; rows(grid)}
    {-1 &lt; m &lt; cols(grid)}
    vector-ref vector-ref(grid n) m

define put!(grid n m v) vector-set!(vector-ref(grid n) m v)
*&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Here are some examples of collecting lists for the let-variable cases:
</p>
<pre>
let &lt;* x 5 *&gt;
  {x + x}
; ==&gt; (let ((x 5)) (+ x x))

let &lt;* x 5 \\ y 7 *&gt;
  {x + x}
; ==&gt; (let ((x 5) (y 7)) (+ x x))
</pre>


<p>
The collecting list symbols are carefully chosen.
The characters &lt; and &gt; are natural character pairs that are
available in ASCII.
What is more, they are not delimiters, so any underlying
Scheme reader will not immediately stop on reading them
(making it easier to reuse).
The &#8220;*&#8221; is more arbitrary, but the collecting list markers
need to be multiple
characters to distinguish them from the less-than and greater-than procedures,
and this seemed to be a fairly distinctive token that is rarely used
in existing code.
</p>

<h3 id="reserved">Reserved marker ($$$)</h3>
<p>
It seems prudent to have a symbol available for future expansion.
Thus, the marker <tt>$$$</tt> is reserved for future use.
This means that <tt>$$$</tt>
must be escaped (e.g., using {...}) if it is used in an
indentation-processing context.
</p>


<h2 id="comparisons">Comparisons to other notations</h2>
<p>
The following subsections compare sweet-expressions to a few
of the many alternative notations that exist
(including some alternatives created during its construction).
</p>


<h3 id="m-expressions">Comparison to M-expressions</h3>

<p>
M-expressions (or meta-expressions) are a notation
developed by John McCarthy, and were intended to be
the primary notation for developing software in Lisp.
As later explained by
<a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp/node3.html">
John McCarthy in &#8220;History of Lisp&#8221; (1979-02-12)</a>,
&#8220;The project of defining M-expressions precisely and compiling them or
at least translating them into S-expressions was neither finalized nor
explicitly abandoned. It just receded into the indefinite future, and a
new generation of programmers appeared who preferred internal notation
to any FORTRAN-like or ALGOL-like notation that could be devised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Documents such as the
<a href="http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%201.5%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf">LISP 1.5 Programmer&#8217;s Manual</a>
do hint at the intended syntax of M-expressions.
Function names were written in lower case letters
(to distinguish them from atoms, which were only upper case),
followed by a pair of square brackets.
Inside the square brackers were semicolon-separated arguments.
Thus, the M-expression
<tt>cons[A;&nbsp;(B&nbsp;C)]</tt>
represented the s-expression
<tt>(cons&nbsp;A&nbsp;(B&nbsp;C))</tt>;
if computed it would produce
<tt>(A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C)</tt>.
M-expressions included some other features, for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The special infix operator &#8220;=&#8221;
could be used to define new functions, and thus was a synonym
for Scheme&#8217;s &#8220;define&#8221;.
An example of its expected use was:
<pre>
    third[x]=car[cdr[cdr[x]]]
</pre>
</li>
<li>
A conditional expression of the form
<tt>[p1 &rarr; e1 ; p2 &rarr; e2 ; ... pn &rarr; en]</tt>
evaluated each p left-to-right; where the first is true,
its corresponding e is returned.
This presumably could map to
<tt>(cond (p1 e1) (p2 e2) ... (pn en))</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The fundamental problem with M-expressions was that they were not general.
When a new syntactic structure was created
(e.g., with a macro), the new construct could easily be
accessed using s-expressions, but not with M-expressions.
Also, M-expressions were never widely implemented;
if you wanted to actually use a Lisp-based language, you had to
use s-expressions.
</p>

<p>
Sweet-expressions avoid these problems of M-expressions.
The sweet-expression notation is not tied to any particular semantic,
and it has been implemented multiple times.
</p>

<h3 id="q2">Comparison to Q2</h3>
<p>An interesting
experimental notation, &#8220;Q2&#8221;, was developed by Per Bothner; see
<a href="http://per.bothner.com/blog/2010/Q2-extensible-syntax/"
rel="nofollow">http://per.bothner.com/blog/2010/Q2-extensible-syntax/</a>.
</p>
<p>Q2 has somewhat similar goals to the &#8220;readable&#8221; project, though
with a different approach. The big difference is that David A. Wheeler
decided it was important to have a general notation for <em>any</em>
s-expression. Here is a brief additional comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sweet-expressions have infix, though not built-in precedence
(precedence can be implemented by defining <tt>$nfx$</tt>).
</li>
<li>Both have &#8220;juxtaposition for function application&#8221;</li>
<li>Q2 has
&#8220;Naming a zero-argument function applies it&#8221; but this is awkward, indeed,
&#8220;The exact rule for a distinguishing between a variable reference
and a zero-argument function application isn&#8217;t decided yet.&#8221; In
sweet-expressions, a zero-argument function name is called by adding
<code>()</code> after it or around it, e.g., <samp>pi()</samp>.</li>
<li>&#8220;Flexible token format&#8221;
- both require operators to be delimited.</li>
<li>&#8220;Use indentation
for grouping&#8221; - both use indentation for grouping</li>
<li>&#8220;Block
expressions yield multiple values&#8221; - In sweet-expressions, you use
usual Scheme procedures, including value, instead of having special
syntax.</li>
<li>REPL: In sweet-expressions, you usually end a line
with ENTER ENTER. Q2 doesn&#8217;t, but Wheeler worries that you have to be careful
or it&#8217;ll end where it syntactically might not need to.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="p4p">Comparison to P4P</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://shriram.github.com/p4p/">
P4P: A Syntax Proposal</a> by Shriram Krishnamurthi
describes an alternative, more readable format for the Racket implementation
of Scheme.
There are some similarities, but many differences.
</p>

<p>
P4P supports functional name-prefixing such as f(x),
just as sweet-expressions do.
However, function parameters are separated by commas
(an extra character not typical in Lisp code, and in our experiments
something of a pain since parameters are very common).
P4P does not support infix notation at all, even though practically
all non-Lisp languages support them.
</p>

<p>
P4P has a very different view of indentation, compared to
sweet-expressions.
In P4P, indentation does not control semantics.
Instead,
&#8220;the semantics controls indentation: that is, each construct has
indentation rules, and the parser enforces them. However, changing the
indentation of a term either leaves the program&#8217;s meaning unchanged
or results in a syntax error; it cannot change the meaning of the
program.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
This means that P4P has a large number of special-case syntactic constructs.
For example, defvar: and deffun: specially use &#8220;=&#8221;,
if: has intermediate keywords, and so on.
While this looks nice when you stay within its set, it encounters
the same problem that McCarthy had with M-expressions: There are always
new constructs, including ones in meta-languages (not the underlying
Scheme implementation) and macros.
The P4P author notes that,
&#8220;it would be easy to add new constructs such as
provide:, test:, defconst: (to distinguish from defvar:), and so on&#8221;,
but this misses the point; the task of defining constructs
inhibits the use of those constructs, and may be impractical
if there are syntactic differences at different language levels.
For example, imagine processing lists where &#8220;deffun&#8221; has a different
definition than the underlying language; this is trivial with
s-expressions and sweet-expressions, but not practical using P4P.
</p>

<p>
The P4P author notes that, &#8220;the parser can be run in a mode where
indentation-checking is simply turned off...
This can be beneficial when dealing with program-generated code.&#8221;
However, now the developer must deal with enabling various modes,
and this mode is needed not just for program-generated code, but for
code that has mixtures of various languages.
Rather than having multiple modes, a single mode that works everywhere
seems more useful to the developers of the sweet-expression notation.
</p>

<p>
In short, P4P fails to be general; it is tied to specific semantics.
Previous readability efforts, such as M-expressions, failed,
and we believe that one reason was that those notations
failed to be general.
We applaud the admirable goals of P4P, but do not think it represents
the best way forward.
</p>

<p>
However, while we believe different design choices need to be made,
we applaud the effort.
In addition, we believe that
P4P is additional evidence that people are interested
in improving the readability of Lisp,
and that indentation can help do so.
</p>

<h3 id="z">Comparison to Z</h3>

<!-- Ben Booth reported this 2012-01-02 to readable-discuss -->

<p>
The
<a href="http://chrisdone.com/z/">
&#8220;Z&#8221; language by Chris Done (not related to the Z specification language)</a>
has been
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/15r6tb/z_a_tiny_strict_impure_dynamically_typed_curried/">
discussed on Reddit</a>,
and was reported to the readable-discuss mailinglist
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/readable-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00872.html">by Ben Booth on 2013-01-02</a>.
It&#8217;s an indentation-based lisp-like language, although the
indentation rules differ somewhat from sweet-expressions.
</p>
<p>
In Z, a whitespace-separated sequence of terms applies to the next, so:
</p>
<pre>
  foo bar mu zot
</pre>
<p>
would parse (in s-expression form) as <tt>(foo (bar (mu zot)))</tt>.
As its documentation states,
&#8220;To pass additional arguments to a function, the arguments are
put on the next line and indented to the column of the first argument&#8221;
</p>
<p>
This is an interesting approach, but David A. Wheeler
agrees with 1337hephaestus_sc2 on Reddit:
&#8220;The main idea seems clever, but also too clever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Here are a few issues with Z syntax compared to sweet-expressions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>When you have multi-parameter functions, this syntax quickly forces
you to grow vertically.  This is exactly the opposite of the actual
real estate available.  Screens are wide and short, and even if you use
traditional paper sizes it&#8217;s wider than tall (typically 80 characters
across, ~66 lines down).</li>
<li>
Edits in one line could quietly change the meaning of other lines,
in non-obvious ways.  If you edit a line with children, you have to make
sure that the lines that follow are moved as well.  An IDE can do this,
but it&#8217;s concerning if an IDE is a practical necessity to edit files.
Here is an example of this meaning change; if you started with:
<pre>
   fee fie foe fum
               foo bar
</pre>
this would be <tt>(fee (fie (foe fun (foo bar))))</tt>, but merely
changing &#8220;fie&#8221; to &#8220;faction&#8221; would produce
<pre>
   fee faction foe fum
               foo bar
</pre>
which would be interpreted as <tt>(fee (faction (foe fum) (foo bar)))</tt>.
</li>
<li>I suspect is that it&#8217;s <i>especially</i> easy to make a mistake with this
notation in a lisp.  Writing &#8220;cons a b&#8221; would seem reasonable enough,
but would be interpreted as (cons (a b)).
</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="genyris">Comparison to Genyris</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/genyris/">Genyris</a> is another
indentation-based Lisp.
&#8220;All Genyris expressions are parsed and stored as linked-lists. A single
line is converted into a single list. Sub-expressions are denoted in two
ways, either within parentheses on a single line, or by an indented line.
For example the following line contains two sub-expressions:
</p>
<pre>
Alpha (Beta Charlie) (Delta)
</pre>
<p>
&#8220;Sub-expressions made using parentheses must remain within a single line,
they are not permitted to wrap. Indented lines are deemed to be
sub-expressions of the superior, less indented, lines above. The above
expression can be written in indented form as follows:&#8221;
</p>
<pre>
Alpha
Beta Charlie
Delta
</pre>
<p>
Thus, it is similar to the main rule of t-expressions, except that
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/genyris/">Genyris</a> wraps
&#8220;ALL sublines in lists, even if they consist of a single element.&#8221;
As
Beni Cherniavsky-Paskin notes,
&#8220;It can get away with that simpler rule because all data objects are
callable and eval to themself...
In fact it&#8217;s much cleverer, though that&#8217;s irrelevant for us.
All objects are actually macros (&#8220;lazy functions&#8221; in the manual&#8217;s
terminology). What objects do if called with arguments - e.g. (&#8220;foo&#8221; arg1
arg2) - is evaluate those arguments in a dynamic-binding env enriched by
the object&#8217;s methods, and return the last value.
Dynamic scope only affects names starting with a dot, other names use
lexical scoping.
All this forms a clever implementation of method calling:
</p>
<pre>
"ball" (.replace "l" "na")
"banana"
</pre>
<p>
While interesting, this notation is less useful for general-purpose
s-expressions, in particular, it makes it more
difficult to notate simple atoms.
</p>

<h3 id="arne">Comparison to the &#8220;Arne formulation&#8221;</h3>
<p>On <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/readable-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01047.html">
2013-02-08, Arne Babenhauserheide made an alternative indentation proposal</a>
and posted it on the readable-discuss mailing list.
</p>

<p>
Aside from the basic indentation-means-subitem,
it has the following important points:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The marker &#8220;<code>:</code>&#8221; indicates that an indentation
is explicitly placed at the column
where that marker is.
That is, you might conceptually consider it
as ending a line,
then inserting an indentation to that column position,
followed by the text after the <code>:</code>.
As a precis, a <code>:</code> on an indented line by itself
is a placeholder
indicating an indentation at its column position,
similar to our GROUP <code>\\</code> marker.
For example, the following are equivalent:
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<th>Arne formulation</th>
<th>Basic indentation format</th>
<th>s-expression</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>
let : : x : compute 'x
      : y : compute 'y
    use x y
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
let
    :
      x
          compute 'x
      y
          compute 'y
    use x y
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
(let
    (
      (x
          (compute 'x))
      (y
          (compute 'y)))
    (use x y))
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
</li>
<li>
A single datum on a line by itself without a child line
is a single-item list;
this is unlike in SRFI-49 or this SRFI,
where a single datum on a line by itself
without a child line is just that datum.
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th>Arne formulation</th><th>s-expression</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>
foo
(bar)
5
#f
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
(foo)
((bar))
(5)
(#f)
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
</li>
<li>
The marker &#8220;<code>.</code>&#8221;,
when it starts a line,
splices the list after it into the parent list.
This is primarily used
to turn the single-item lists
formed by the previous rule
into actual single datums.
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th>Arne formulation</th><th>s-expression</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>
foo
  bar
  . 5
  . #f #t "hello"
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
(foo
  (bar)
  5
  #f #t "hello")
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
</li>
<li>
Inconsistent dedents are accepted.
For example,
the following text is accepted in Arne&#8217;s formulation,
but would be rejected as an error by this SRFI:
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th>Arne formulation</th><th>s-expression</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>
foo
    bar quux
  kuu nitz
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
(foo
    (bar quux)
  (kuu nitz))
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
After being proposed,
it was suggested that the rule 2 above
should be amended
to be similar to equivalent rules in SRFI-49 and this SRFI;
that is, a single datum on a line by itself
should be only that datum, not wrapped in a list.
Further, a &#8220;.&#8221; marker followed by
a single datum without a child line
should be a no-op.
</p>
<p>
Rule 2 was formulated that way
since the intention was
to build an indentation processor, not a full parser.
However, further discussion revealed
that a simple rule could be formulated
to differentiate between one-item and two-item lines;
specifically, a space outside of parentheses or strings
indicated that the line had two or more items.
Thus even a simple indentation processor
could support SRFI-49-like rule 2.
</p>

<p>
This proposal was initially quite attractive
(at least to Alan Manuel K. Gloria).
It is simpler to describe informally,
and appears, at first glance,
to replace many actual uses for
GROUP/SPLIT, SUBLIST, and COLLECTINGLIST.
Thus, it was hoped that these three extensions
could be removed with the simpler <code>:</code> marker rule.
</p>

<p>
However, there are use cases
where SUBLIST has superior semantics
over Arne&#8217;s <code>:</code>.
For instance, consider the following SUBLIST code:
</p>
<pre>
call/cc $ lambda (exit)
  body
  ...
</pre>
<p>
Replacing this with Arne&#8217;s <code>:</code> requires
further indenting the body
to after the <code>:</code> marker.
</p>
<pre>
call/cc : lambda (exit)
            body
            ...
</pre>
<p>
With Arne&#8217;s formulation, a trade-off exists:
either
(1) add a separate line for the <code>lambda</code>
(which increases vertical lines
in exchange for reduced indentation),
or (2) use <code>:</code>
(which increases horizontal indentation
in exchange for reduced vertical lines).
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th>either (1)</th><th>or (2)</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>
call/cc
  lambda (exit)
    body
    ...
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
call/cc : lambda (exit)
            body
            ...
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
SUBLIST is powerful precisely because it collects child lines.
This allows you to simultaneously reduce
horizontal indentation and vertical lines.
</p>

<p>
The <code>:</code> and <code>.</code> markers
are also insufficient replacements for GROUP/SPLIT.
At first glance it might seem that <code>.</code> is superior
to the SPLIT meaning of <code>\\</code>:
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th>Arne&#8217;s formulation</th><th>sweet-expression</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>
export
  . api-init api-use api-close
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
export
  api-init \\ api-use \\ api-close
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
But we expect that more typically,
you want to express the code that looks like this:
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th>Arne&#8217;s formulation</th><th>sweet-expression</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>
begin
  . (display "Welcome, ") (display player) (display ", to the Dungeons!") (newline)
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
begin
  display "Welcome, " \\ display player \\ display ", to the Dungeons!" \\ (newline)
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
If you truly want several single items to be spliced,
the following trick takes advantage
of the fact that indentation processing
is disabled inside parentheses:
</p>
<pre>
export . (
  api-init api-use api-close
)
</pre>
<p>
Arne&#8217;s formulation also does not have
a method to conveniently express
a single gigantic top-level datum
that contains several complex sub-datums,
a.k.a. the <code>define-library</code> problem.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;* define-library \\ (example)
import (scheme base)
export . (
  example-init
  example-open example-close
)
&lt;* begin

define example-init()
  whatever ...
  ...

define example-open(x)
  whatever ...
  ...

define example-close(y)
  whatever ...
  ...

*&gt;; begin
*&gt;; define-library
</pre>
<p>
We could retain COLLECTINGLIST,
and live without the SPLIT behavior,
or even SUBLIST,
though this would be important losses.
Conversely, they could be re-added, but at
that point, its simplicity has completely disappeared.
But these ignore the biggest problem.
</p>
<p>
The most important problem with this proposal
is that it falsely assumes
that it&#8217;s possible to know the visual width of different characters.
In today&#8217;s world, this is impractical, especially across
the many different implementations of Scheme and other Lisps.
</p>
<p>
Most obviously this presumption is false on systems with variable-width
fonts, and tehse are widely used for email messages.
You simply cannot presume you know anything about the actual widths
of different character sequences in this case.
</p>
<p>
For another example, some East Asian characters,
<a href='http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/'>called fullwidth characters</a>,
should be displayed on two columns
even on a fixed-width font display.
In Arne&#8217;s formulation,
the width of non-whitespace characters
is significant,
since the <code>:</code> marker can record
the column position
after non-whitespace characters occur.
This SRFI, on the other hand,
requires recording only the column position
of horizontal whitespace characters;
we handle the different possible widths
of the TAB character
by requiring consistent indentation.
</p>
<p>
Arne&#8217;s formulation requires either that implementations
know all fullwidth characters
(a much longer list
than the list of horizontal whitespace characters),
or would leave handling of fullwidth characters
up to implementations,
meaning that indentation expressions
have potential portability problems.
</p>
<p>
Granted that almost all code
will not utilize symbols
containing fullwidth East Asian glyphs,
one must consider <em>strings</em>
containing fullwidth East Asian glyphs,
which we expect to occur regularly in East Asia.
</p>
<p>
This also brings the issue of character encoding.
To properly recognize fullwidth characters,
the encoding must be known.
Granted, many East Asian-specific encodings
use two bytes for fullwidth characters,
and one byte for halfwidth characters.
So a simple byte-as-character interpretation
would keep track of column positions correctly,
if you are using such a East Asian-specific encoding.
Until you re-encode the text into UTF-8.
</p>
<p>
UTF-8 use is spreading;
it can encode any Unicode code point,
and is largely back-compatible with ASCII.
But East Asian fullwidth characters
do not necessarily encode in two bytes in UTF-8.
Not to mention that many more characters in UTF-8
are encoded in 3 or more bytes
but do not take 3 or more columns,
just one.
Characters which can occur in strings,
which might usefully be placed before
some <code>:</code> marker.
</p>
<p>
If we are sensitive to only initial indentation,
then we need only worry about the widths of two characters,
TAB and SPACE (and <code>!</code> for this SRFI).
This causes no problems in this SRFI, because
indentation is required to be consistent across lines.
In contrast, in Arne&#8217;s proposal,
we need to worry about the widths of every character,
and also know the encoding.
Scheme code (and Lisp code in general)
will increasingly need to embed strings
with international (non-ASCII) characters,
and R7RS at least allows optional support for symbols
that contain international (non-ASCII) characters.
R6RS mandates that support.

<h3 id="closing-sublist-unmatched-dedent">Closing SUBLIST by unmatched dedent (&#8220;Beni Formulation of SUBLIST&#8221)</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/readable-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01082.html">
On 2013-02-18, Beni Cherniavsky-Paskin
proposed an extension of SUBLIST semantics, to
&#8220;allow closing SUBLIST by [partial] dedenting&#8221;</a>.
Informally, in Beni&#8217;s proposed extension,
any occurrence of SUBLIST would mark a fresh indent level,
which could be matched by an otherwise-unmatched dedent.
For example:
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th>Extended SUBLIST</th><th>Equivalent</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>
outer1 outer2 $ inner1
! ! inner2
! outer3
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
outer1 outer2
! inner1
! ! inner2
! outer3
</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre>
let $
! ! x $ compute 'x
! ! y $ compute 'y
! use x y
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
let
! \\
! ! x $ compute 'x
! ! y $ compute 'y
! use x y
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The original formal description by Beni Cherniavsky-Paskin,
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/readable-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01100.html">
as expanded by Alan Manuel K. Gloria</a>,
involves moving SUBLIST and SPLIT processing
from the parser to the indentation preprocessor
(i.e. the part that inserts INDENT and DEDENT tokens).
In the current specifications, the indentation preprocessor
handles a stack of indentations
(in the implementation, a cons-cell stack of strings).
Beni&#8217;s formulation expands this stack
to include the special indentation marker <code>?</code>.
In the succeeding formal description,
we assume two variables,
the <code>indentation-stack</code>
and <code>current-indentation</code>.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
On encountering a SUBLIST,
consume the SUBLIST and emit INDENT.
Push <code>?</code> on <code>indentation-stack</code>.
</li>
<li>
On encountering an inline GROUP/SPLIT
(i.e. SPLIT meaning),
consume it, then:
<ol>
<li>
If <code>indentation-stack</code>&#8217;s top is <code>?</code>:
Pop off every <code>?</code>
on top of <code>indentation-stack</code>
and emit DEDENT for each popped item.
</li>
<li>
Otherwise, emit SAME.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
On encountering an EOL,
consume it,
then consume indentation whitespace
(<code>(TAB | SPACE | !)*</code>)
and put it in <code>current-indentation</code>.
Then:
<ol>
<li>
If the <code>indentation-stack</code>&#8217;s topmost non-<code>?</code> item
is &#8220;not consistent&#8221; with <code>current-indentation</code>,
signal a bad indent error (BADDENT).
</li>
<li>
If the <code>indentation-stack</code>&#8217;s topmost non-<code>?</code> item
is less than <code>current-indentation</code>,
push <code>current-indentation</code> on <code>indentation-stack</code>
and emit INDENT.
</li>
<li>
If the <code>indentation-stack</code>&#8217;s topmost non-<code>?</code> item
is equal to <code>current-indentation</code>:
<small>(note: this is a copy of 2.1 and 2.2 above)</small>
<ol>
<li>
If <code>indentation-stack</code>&#8217;s top is <code>?</code>:
Pop off every <code>?</code>
on top of <code>indentation-stack</code>
and emit DEDENT for each popped item.
</li>
<li>
Otherwise, emit SAME.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
Otherwise, the <code>indentation-stack</code>&#8217;s topmost non-<code>?</code> item
is greater than <code>current-indentation</code>:
<ol>
<li>
Pop off stack items until
<code>indentation-stack</code>&#8217;s topmost non-<code>?</code> item
is less than or equal to <code>current-indentation</code>;
emit a DEDENT for each popped item.
</li>
<li>
If the <code>indentation-stack</code>&#8217;s topmost non-<code>?</code> item
is equal to <code>current-indentation</code>,
pop off all <code>?</code> and emit a DEDENT for each.
</li>
<li>
Otherwise, if the <code>indentation-stack</code>&#8217;s top is <code>?</code>,
pop it off and push <code>current-indentation</code> on the stack.
</li>
<li>
Otherwise, this is a DEDENT
that is not matched by an earlier INDENT
and is not matched by an earlier SUBLIST,
so signal an error (BADDENT).
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
This extension of SUBLIST
turns out to be backward-compatible
with the current SUBLIST semantics,
in the sense that
any SUBLIST-using text
constructed using the current SUBLIST semantics
would have <em>exactly</em> the same meaning
in Beni&#8217;s extended SUBLIST semantics.
This is a significant advantage
as it means we can apply this extended rule
at any future time
without fear of breaking existing code.
</p>


<p>
Alan Manuel K. Gloria was excited with this proposal,
and considered it superior to his original SUBLIST formulation,
but David A. Wheeler was much more reserved.
The following concerns were noted about this formulation:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
It complicates explanation of &#8220;$&#8221; and is more difficult to
describe infomally.
If we used this semantic,
some people would require
a second explanation of SUBLIST (&#8220;$&#8221;)
that is essentially identical
to the current description here.
Every time we add a complication,
we risk losing some potential users and implementers.
</li>
<li>
We leave better-understood parsing theory if this is added.
Existing approaches
tend to follow Python or Haskell approaches and specifically
consider the actual source stream to have matching indentations and
dedentations.
We want to have this easily implemented, with many reasons to
be confident that it is well-designed;
the more we leave established theory, the harder it is to do that.
David A. Wheeeler in particular wanted
to make sure that the constructs are clearly and
unambiguously defined as part of some well-checked BNF grammar.
</li>
<li>
It complicates the definition of the notation and weakens error-checking
for correctness of the notation.
Moving handling from the parser to the indentation preprocessor
meant that many tools for proving parser correctness (i.e. ANTLR)
could not be used on the extended handling.
We want this notation to work &#8220;because it&#8217;s clearly correct&#8221;;
using ANTLR to check it rigorously is a valuable way to get there.
In addition, the formal rules
for this extended SUBLIST
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/readable-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01105.html">
are difficult to reason about
(&#8220;(pft)... That&#8217;s the sound of my head exploding&#8221;)</a>.
</li>
<li>
It complicates the implementation.
</li>
<li>
This partly disables error-checking for code that uses sweet-expressions.
With this, incorrect indentation after uses of SUBLIST
become a potential source of silently passed mistakes.
</li>
<li>
It can be viewed as complicating the reading of code that uses it.
Up to this point, a dedent always ended the whole line above; now it
can end it a part.
It is unclear that the reduction in line count is fair compensation.
</li>
<li>
It&#8217;s not clear (at least to David A. Wheeler)
that there&#8217;s enough <i>value</i> to adding it.
&#8220;There *ARE* use cases, and these use cases are
definitely common enough to discuss doing something special with them.
But I worry that the contravening downsides will overwhelm it.
Currently, in certain cases we have to add &#8216;\\&#8217; -only lines;
that&#8217;s not really
a hardship, especially since the resulting constructs
are pretty easy to understand.&#8221;
In particular, the given <code>let</code> example above remains
(as of the time of this writing)
the only significant use case
for Beni&#8217;s extended SUBLIST formulation,
and there are already other relatively-painless
ways to handle this construct.
</li>
<li>
This &#8220;partial dedenting&#8221; approach is
backwards-compatible with the current specification,
and thus could be added <i>later</i> if desired.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
David A. Wheeler mentioned the possibility of using
a PARTIAL_DEDENT token
so that full Beni formulation of SUBLIST
could be handled completely in the parser.
This possibility has not been explored fully as yet.
It may be explored if further use cases
for the full Beni formulation
are found in the future.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/readable-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01115.html">
Alan Manuel K. Gloria continues to hold out hope
that this extended formulation will get more use-cases</a>,
but decided not to press for <em>immediate</em> inclusion
in this SRFI.
</p>

<p>
Beni Cherniavsky-Paskin&#8217; himself noted that this proposal is
&#8220;a backward-compatible extension to SUBLIST (similarly applicable to
any competing FOOLIST semantics), so we could leave it undecided for now,
and legalize it later...&#8221;.
For the moment, that is what we have done; we have ensured that
it could be added later if turns out to be important to do so.
</p>



<h3 id="closing-ending-sublist-results">Variation: Closing end-of-line SUBLIST by unmatched dedent (&#8220;Beni-Lite&#8221;)</h3>
<p>
On 2013-02-23, David A. Wheeler counterproposed (for purposes
of experimentation) a subset of Beni Cherniavsky-Paskin&#8217;s proposal.
He christened the approach &#8220;Beni-Lite&#8221;,
and included a sample implementation using ANTLR and its BNF.
This was eventually rejected, but
we believe it&#8217;s important to document this approach -
in part because it could be added later if desired.
</p>
<p>
In this alternative, a &#8220;$&#8221; can be closed by an unmatched partial
dedent, but only if the &#8220;$&#8221; is at the end of a line and there is
other text besides any indentation characters.
The primary argument given for this variant is that it
covers the primary use cases David A. Wheeler had seen, and
it is possible to formulate this limited variant while continuing
to use ANTLR&#8217;s grammar checking.
It also retains stronger run-time input checking; partial dedents
are only legal when including &#8220;$&#8221; at the end of the line, making them
unlikely to use accidentally.
It is still complicated, but it is not much more complicated than
notations without unmatched dedents.
</p>
<p>
Here are some sample test cases to demonstrate its impact:
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<th>Original Input</th><th>s-expression</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
let $
! ! var1 value1
! body...
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
(let
  ((var1 value1))
  body...)
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<pre>
let $
! ! var1 value1
! ! var2 value2
! body...
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
(let
  ((var1 value1)
   (var2 value2))
  body...)
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<pre>
let $
! ! var1 value1
! ! var2 value2
! ! var3 value3
! body1 param1
! body2 param2
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
(let
  ((var1 value1)
   (var2 value2)
   (var3 value3))
  (body1 param1)
  (body2 param2))
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The sample implementation tweaked the indent processor so that
if a dedent doesn&#8217;t match the parent indent, it generates DEDENT
followed by a RE_INDENT.
Here is an example of how the modified indent processor could tokenize
its input:
</p>
<!-- Here's sample code, from ANTLR:
       if (!indents.peek().equals(indent_text)) {
-       // System.out.print("Generate BADDENT(s)\n");
-        t.setType(BADDENT);
-        emit(t);
+        if ( (indents.peek().length() < indent_text.length()) &&
+             (indent_text.length() < deepest.length()) &&
+             deepest.startsWith(indent_text) ) {
+          emit_type(RE_INDENT);
+          indents.push(indent_text);
+        } else {
+          // System.out.print("Generate BADDENT(s)\n");
+          t.setType(BADDENT);
+          emit(t);
+        }
-->

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<th>Original Input</th><th>Tokenized version</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
let $
! ! var1 value1
! body...
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
let SUBLIST EOL
INDENT var1 value2 EOL
DEDENT RE_INDENT body...
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The BNF was then changed so that SUBLIST allowed more constructs:
</p>
<pre>
it_expr returns [Object v]
  : head
    ...
     | SUBLIST hspace* /* head SUBLIST ... case */
       (sub_i=it_expr {(append $head (list $sub_i))}
        | comment_eol indent sub_b=body
          ( re_indent partial_out=body
             {(append (append $head (list $sub_b)) $partial_out)}
           | empty {(append $head (list $sub_b))} ) )
  ...
  | SUBLIST hspace* /* "$" first on line */
    (is_i=it_expr {(list $is_i)}
     | comment_eol indent sub_body=body {(list $sub_body)} )
</pre>


<p>
However, Alan Manuel Gloria reviewed it and stated that,
&#8220;I think that, conceptually, having a limitation is an additional
complication when teaching the notation...
Granted we could just mandate these patterns, but I worry that we are
now slipping into the &#8216;notation is tied to underlying semantic&#8217; bug.
Or in this case, &#8216;notation is tied to underlying legacy syntax&#8217;.
I&#8217;d rather have the full Beni formulation of SUBLIST or the classic
0.4 formulation, in that preference order.
I&#8217;ll admit that I don&#8217;t have a use for the full Beni formulation other
than for let, though.  I suspect there may be further use cases; but I
haven&#8217;t found any others yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The current notation does not support either approach at this time.
However, the BNF specifically requires that these constructs be
detected and forbidden; that way, if future versions add these capabilities,
it will be known that they cannot have any other meaning in
existing sweet-expressions.
</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience using and implementing sweet-expressions</h2>
<p>
At least two programs have been written using sweet-expressions:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net"><i>sweeten</i></a>
by David A. Wheeler is
a program that reads traditionally-formatted
s-expressions and writes sweet-expressions.
This program performs a great deal of traditional list processing, and
is part of the &#8220;readable&#8221; project&#8217;s git repository.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AmkG/letterfall"><i>letterfall</i></a>
by Alan Manuel K. Gloria is a graphical
real-time touch typing game to improve typing skills, which uses
GNOME libraries.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The SRFI authors believe that the existence of these programs -
written by two different people for different application areas -
shows that sweet-expressions are mature enough to be standardized.
</p>
<p>
The sweet-expression notation itself has been implemented at least twice;
one in ANTLR (an LL(*) parser generator)
and one in Scheme (as a recursive descent parser).
Since it has been implemented two different ways, it is less likely to
be extremely difficult to implement.
The ANTLR grammar itself has been checked by ANTLR&#8217;s grammar checker
for ambiguities and other problems.
Also, ANTLR confirms that the given BNF grammar is LL(1).
These implementations, and the ANTLR checking, suggest that this
notation is not too difficult to implement and eliminates the risks
of certain kinds of grammar flaws.
These implementations have been peer reviewed and passed various test suites.

<p>
The <a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net">Readable Lisp S-expressions Project</a> developed these notations and implementations of them.
In particular, the project distributes the programs
<i>unsweeten</i> (which takes sweet-expressions and transforms them
into s-expressions) and
<i>sweeten</i> (which takes s-expressions and transforms them into
sweet-expressions), as well as other related tools.

<h1><a name="reference-implementation">Reference implementation</a></h1>

<p>The reference implementation is portable, with the exception that
Scheme provides no standard mechanism to override the built-in reader.
An implementation that complies with this SRFI must
at least activate this behavior
when they read the <code>#!sweet</code> marker
followed by whitespace.
</p>
<p>The reference implementation is SRFI type 2: &#8220;A
mostly-portable solution that uses some kind of hooks provided in
some Scheme interpreter/compiler. In this case, a detailed
specification of the hooks must be included so that the SRFI is
self-contained.&#8221;</p>
<p>
See 
<a href="src/kernel.scm">the Scheme source code
for the reference implementation</a>.
