<h1><a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>
Many software developers find Lisp s-expression notation inconvenient and
unpleasant to read, in part because of the many parentheses required
in typical use.
Even those who like Lisp s-expression syntax typically use indentation
to show structure, and not just parentheses,
because structure is not obvious in raw un-indented s-expressions.
This SRFI defines an indentation-sensitive syntax, inspired by Python;
indentation-sensitive syntax eliminates the need for many parentheses
and the need to synchronize indentation with parentheses.
The previous
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/">SRFI-49</a> defines an
indentation-sensitive syntax, but in practice it is somewhat awkward,
and by itself it lacks
support for infix notation (e.g., <samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b}</samp>)
and prefix formats (e.g., <samp>f(x)</samp>).
</p>
<p>
This SRFI defines sweet-expressions (aka t-expressions),
an indentation-sensitive syntax developed from
experience in implementing real Scheme programs.
It is derived from
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/">SRFI-49</a>
and includes (by reference)
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-105/">SRFI-105</a>.
Unlike most past efforts to make Lisp more &#8220;readable&#8221;,
the sweet-expression notation is
generic (the notation does not depend on an underlying semantic),
homoiconic (the underlying data structure is clear from the syntax), and
backwards-compatible with well-formatted s-expressions.
</p>
<p>
For example, the following sweet-expression:
</p>
<pre>
define factorial(n)
  if {n <= 1}
    1
    {n * factorial{n - 1}}
</pre>
<p>
Maps to the following s-expression:
</p>
<pre>
(define (factorial n)
  (if (<= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
</pre>

<p>
A sweet-expression reader would accept <i>either</i> form.
Note that the sweet-expression notation was developed by the
&#8220;<a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net/">Readable Lisp S-expressions Project</a>&#8221;.
</p>

<h1><a name="rationale">Rationale</a></h1>
<p>
The large number of parentheses required by Lisp syntax is the butt
of many jokes in the software development community
and has been widely criticized.
The
<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/L/LISP.html">Jargon File</a>
says that Lisp is
&#8220;mythically from &#8216;Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses&#8217;&#8221;.
<a href="http://fortunes.cat-v.org/kernelnewbies/">Linus Torvalds</a>
commented about some parentheses-rich C code,
&#8220;don&#8217;t ask me about the extraneous parenthesis.  I bet some
LISP programmer felt alone and decided to make it a bit more homey.&#8221;
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2070">
Larry Wall, the creator of Perl</a>, says that,
&#8220;Lisp has all the visual appeal of oatmeal
with fingernail clippings mixed in.
(Other than that, it&#8217;s quite a nice language.)&#8221;.
<a href="http://shriram.github.com/p4p/">Shriram Krishnamurthi</a> says,
&#8220;Racket [(a Scheme implementation)] has an excellent language design,
a great implementation, a superb programming environment, and terrific tools.
Mainstream adoption will, however, always be curtailed by the syntax.
Racket could benefit from [reducing]
the layers of parenthetical adipose that [needlessly] engird it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Since Lisp programs and data are often written using indentation anyway,
it seems reasonable to create
an indentation-sensitive syntax that would eliminate the need for
many of these &#8220;superfluous&#8221; parentheses, as well as eliminating the
need to keep the indentation and parentheses synchronized.
</p>
<p>
This is not a new observation.
<a href="http://paulgraham.com/popular.html">Lisp advocate
Paul Graham says</a>, regarding Lisp syntax,
&#8220;A more serious problem [in Lisp] is the diffuseness of prefix notation...
We can get rid of (or make optional) a lot of parentheses by making
indentation significant.
That&#8217;s how programmers read code anyway: when indentation says
one thing and delimiters say another, we go by the indentation.
Treating indentation as significant would eliminate this
common source of bugs as well as making programs shorter.
Sometimes infix syntax is easier to read. This is especially true for
math expressions. I&#8217;ve used Lisp my whole programming life and I still
don&#8217;t find prefix math expressions natural...
I don&#8217;t think we should be religiously opposed to introducing syntax
into Lisp, as long as it translates in a well-understood
way into underlying s-expressions.
There is already a good deal of syntax in Lisp.
It&#8217;s not necessarily bad to introduce more,
as long as no one is forced to use it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The indentation-sensitive syntax defined in this SRFI
is generic (the notation does not depend on an underlying semantic)
and homoiconic (the underlying data structure is clear from the syntax).
We believe previous efforts to improve the readability of
Lisp s-expressions, such as McCarthy&#8217;s M-expressions, failed because
they failed to be generic or homoiconic.
It often difficult to easily access new capabilities
(such as those defined by macros) in notations that are not
generic or homoiconic.
In contrast, because sweet-expressions <i>are</i> generic and homoiconic,
they can be easily used with other constructs
such as quasiquoting and macros.
In short, if a capability can be accessed using s-expressions, then they
can be accessed without any additional effort using sweet-expressions.
The indentation processing is simply
an abbreviation, in much the same way that
<samp>&#39;x</samp> is an abbreviation for <samp>(quote&nbsp;x)</samp>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/">SRFI-49</a> defines an
indentation-sensitive syntax.
Unfortunately, it has not been widely deployed among Scheme implementations.
We believe this is, at least in part,
because of various problems and limitations in it,
<a href="#srfi-49">described in more detail below</a>.
Nevertheless, SRFI-49 represented an important first step in devising
an indentation-sensitive syntax; sweet-expressions are derived from SRFI-49
and retain most of its syntax.

</p>
<p>
The notation defined in this sweet-expressions SRFI
is intentionally designed so that, unlike Python,
it works exactly the same way in both interactive mode (e.g., a REPL)
and when processing a file.
A difference in modes could cause failure when
cutting-and-pasting between a file and an interactive session.
Since many users often switch between the REPL and files,
such a difference was considered unacceptable.
</p>
<p>This notation is <em>simple</em> and <em>straightforward</em>.
It basically defines a few additional abbreviations
for s-expressions based on real-world experience.
</p>

<p>
See the <a href="#design-rationale">design rationale</a> for a detailed
discussion on how and why it is designed this way.

<h1><a name="specification">Specification</a></h1>
<p>
The key words
&#8220;<em>MUST</em>&#8221;,
&#8220;<em>MUST NOT</em>&#8221;,
&#8220;<em>REQUIRED</em>&#8221;,
&#8220;<em>SHALL</em>&#8221;,
&#8220;<em>SHALL NOT</em>&#8221;,
&#8220;<em>SHOULD</em>&#8221;,
&#8220;<em>SHOULD NOT</em>&#8221;,
&#8220;<em>RECOMMENDED</em>&#8221;,
&#8220;<em>MAY</em>&#8221;,
and &#8220;<em>OPTIONAL</em>&#8221; in this
document are to be interpreted as described in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>.
</p>

<p>
<p>&#8220;<dfn>Sweet-expressions</dfn>&#8221; (aka &#8220;<dfn>t-expressions</dfn>&#8221;) deduce parentheses from indentation.
A sweet-expression reader <em>MUST</em> interpret its input
as follows when indentation processing is active:
<ol>
<li>An indented line is a parameter of its parent.</li>
<li>Later terms on a line are parameters of the first term.</li>
<li>A line with exactly one term, and no child lines, is simply that term; multiple terms are wrapped into a list.</li>
<li>An empty line ends the expression; empty lines before expressions are ignored.</li>
<li>Terms are neoteric-expressions as defined in
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-105/">SRFI-105</a>.
Thus <samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b}</samp> maps to <samp>(+&nbsp;a&nbsp;b)</samp>,
<samp>f(...)</samp> maps to <samp>(f&nbsp;...)</samp>, and
<samp>f{...}</samp> with non-empty content
maps to <samp>(f&nbsp;{...})</samp>.</li>
<li>When reading begins, indentation processing is active, but indentation processing is disabled inside ( ), [ ], and { }, whether they are prefixed or not
(inside they&#8217;re a sequence of
whitespace-separated neoteric-expressions).</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Sweet-expression rule clarifications:
<ol>
<li>You can indent using one or more of the indent characters,
which are space, tab, and exclamation point (!).</li>
<li>An unescaped &#8220;;&#8221; not in a string (still) introduces comments
that end at the end of the line or file.</li>
<li>Lines with only a ;-comment (preceded by 0 or more indent characters)
are completely ignored - even their indentation (if any) is irrelevant.</li>
<li>A line with only indentation is an empty line.</li>
<li>An expression that starts indented enables &#8220;indented-compatibility&#8221; mode,
where indentation is completely ignored.
Instead, a sequence of white-space separated neoteric-expressions is read
until the first end of line or end of file.</li>
<li>Scheme&#8217;s #; datum comment comments out the next neoteric expression,
not the next sweet expression.</li>
<li>Block comments (<samp>#|</samp>...<samp>|#</samp>) are removed, but if it
begins immediately after the indent (if any),
the indentation at the beginning of the block comment is used.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The sweet-expression advanced features are defined as follows:
<ol>
<li>The marker \\ is specially interpreted.  If any terms precede it on the line, it is called SPLIT, and it <em>MUST</em> be interpreted as if it started a new line at the current indentation.  If no terms precede \\ on the line, it is called GROUP, and it represents no symbol at all at that indentation (GROUP is useful for lists of lists).</li>
<li>The marker $ (aka SUBLIST) <em>MUST</em> restart list processing.  If $ is preceded by any terms on the line, the right-hand-side (including its sub-blocks) is the last parameter of the left-hand side (of just that line). If there&#8217;s no left-hand-side, the right-hand-side is put in a list.</li>
<li>A leading traditional abbreviation (quote, comma, backquote, or comma-at), followed by space or tab, <em>MUST</em> be interpreted as that operator applied to the entire sweet-expression that follows.</li>
<li>The markers &#8220;&lt;*&#8221;, &#8220;*&gt;&#8221;, and &#8220;$$$&#8221; are reserved for future use.
</ol>

<p>
The markers for the advanced sweet-expression features <em>MUST</em>
only be accepted as such when indentation processing is active,
and <em>MUST</em> only be
interpreted as above if they begin with their characters as shown.
For example, <samp><tt>{$}</tt></samp>
<em>MUST NOT</em> be interpreted as the SUBLIST marker; instead, it
<em>MUST</em> be interpreted as the symbol <samp>$</samp>.
</p>

<p>A <dfn>sweet-expression reader</dfn> is a datum reader
that can correctly read and map sweet-expressions as defined above
(including the advanced sweet-expression features).
An implementation of this SRFI <em>MUST</em> accept
the marker <code>#!sweet</code> followed by a whitespace character
in its standard datum readers (e.g., <code>read</code> and, if applicable,
the default implementation REPL).
This marker (including the trailing whitespace character)
<em>MUST</em> be consumed and considered whitespace.
After reading this marker, the reader <em>MUST</em> accept
sweet-expressions in subsequent datums read from the same port,
overriding any conflicting marker (such as <code>#!curly-infix</code>
followed by whitespace)
until some other conflicting marker is given.
</p>

<p>
Implementations of this SRFI <em>MAY</em>
implement sweet-expressions in their datum readers by default,
even when the marker is not (yet) received.
Portable applications <em>SHOULD</em> include the <code>#!sweet</code>
marker before using sweet-expressions, typically near the top of a file.
Portable applications <em>SHOULD NOT</em>
use this marker as the very first characters
of a file (e.g., it could be preceded by a newline),
because they might be misinterpreted on some platforms
as an executable script header.
</p>

<p>
Implementations <em>MAY</em> provide the procedures
<var>sweet-read</var> as a sweet-expression reader and/or
<var>neoteric-read</var> as a neoteric-expression reader.
If provided, these procedures
<em>SHOULD</em> support an optional port parameter.
</p>

<p>
Implementations <em>SHOULD</em> enable a sweet-expression reader when
reading a file whose name ends in &#8220;.sscm&#8221; (Sweet Scheme).
Application authors <em>SHOULD</em> use the
filename extension &#8220;.sscm&#8221;
when writing portable Scheme programs using sweet-expressions.
</p>

<p>
A program editor <em>MAY</em> usefully highlight
blank lines (as they separate expressions) and lines beginning at the
left column (as these start new expressions).
We <em>RECOMMEND</em> that program editors highlight
expressions whose first line is indented,
to reduce the risk of their accidental use.
</p>

<p>
A tool that reads sweet-expressions and writes out
s-expressions <em>SHOULD</em> specially treat
lines that begin with a semicolon
when they are not currently reading an expression (e.g., no expression has
been read, or the last expression read has been completed with a blank line).
Such a tool <em>SHOULD</em>
(when outside an expression) copy exactly
any line beginning with semicolon followed by a whitespace,
semicolon, or end-of-file.
Such a tool <em>SHOULD</em>
(when outside an expression) also
copy lines beginning with ";#" or ";!"
without the leading semicolon,
and copy lines beginning with ";_"
without either of those first two characters.
Application authors <em>SHOULD</em>
follow a semicolon in the first column with a whitespace character
or semicolon if they mean for it to be a comment.
</p>

<p>Note that, by definition, this SRFI modifies lexical syntax.</p>

<h2><a name="bnf">BNF</a></h2>
<p>
The following BNF defines sweet-expressions.
It is intended to capture the specification above; in case of (unintentional)
conflict, the specification text above governs.

</p>

<h1><a name="examples">Examples</a></h1>
<p>
Here are some examples and their mappings.
Note that a sweet-expression reader would accept either form in all cases,
since a sweet-expression reader is for the most part a
traditional s-expression reader with support for some additional abbreviations.

<h1><a name="design-rationale">Design Rationale</a></h1>

<p>
This SRFI design
rationale is unusually long, especially when you compare it to
the simplicity of its specification.
We have separated the design rationale from the overall rationale,
as was previously done by SRFI-26, because it is easier to
understand the design rationale after reading the specification.
</p>

<h2 id="general-and-homoiconic">General and homoiconic formats</h2>

<p>There have been a huge number of past efforts
to create readable formats for Lisp-based languages,
going all the way back to the original
M-expression syntax that Lisp&#8217;s creator expected to be used when
programming.  Generally, they&#8217;ve been unsuccessful, or they end up
creating a completely different language that lacks the advantages
of Lisp-based languages.
</p>

<p>
After examining a huge number of them,
David A. Wheeler noticed a pattern: Past &#8220;readable&#8221; Lisp notations
typically failed to be <em>general</em> or <em>homoiconic</em>:
<ul>
<li>
A <em>general</em>
format is <em>not</em> tied to some specific underlying semantic.
Most readability efforts focused on creating special syntax for each
language construct of an underlying language.  But since Lisp-based
languages can trivially create new semantic constructs (via macros), and
are often used to process fragments of <em>other</em> languages, these
did not work well.  It was often difficult to keep updating the parser to
match the underlying system, so the parser was always less capable than
using s-expressions... leading to its abandonment.
One example of this process, among many, is the
IACL2 (Infix ACL2) interface of ACL2.
Sometimes the parser
was continuously maintained, but this led to the development
of a completely new language that was less suitable for self-analysis
of program fragments and similar tasks (and thus no longer a suitable
&#8220;Lisp&#8221;).
Any new notation should be general.
It&#8217;s easy to create a new &#8220;operator&#8221; in a Lisp, yet many
infix systems cannot work without having its precedence predefined.
Similarly, it&#8217;s easy to create a macro in Lisp, and using it must not
require that the parser be changed each time.
</li>
<li>
A <em>homoiconic</em> format is a surface format in which the <em>human</em>
reader can easily determine what the underlying representation is.
It is very difficult to take advantage of Lisp capabilities, such as
macros, without a homoiconic format. Yet many past readability efforts
made it difficult to determine exactly what structures were being
created by the notation.  Typical infix notations with precedence were
especially common examples of this problem - they would quietly create
multiple lists without obvious indications that this was happening.

Top Down Operator Precedence by Douglas Crockford
(2007-02-21)</a>, for example, discusses Vaughan Pratt&#8217;s &#8220;Top Down

He stated that &#8220;parsing techniques are not greatly valued in the
LISP community, which celebrates the Spartan denial of syntax.

have been many attempts since LISP&#8217;s creation to give the language a
rich ALGOL-like syntax, including Pratt&#8217;s CGOL, LISP 2, MLISP, Dylan,
Interlisp&#8217;s Clisp, and McCarthy&#8217;s original M-expressions. All failed
to find acceptance. That community found the correspondence between
programs and data to be much more valuable than expressive syntax. But
the mainstream programming community likes its syntax, so LISP has
never been accepted by the mainstream.&#8221;
As discussed below,
<a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Hopl2.pdf">
&#8220;The Evolution of Lisp&#8221; by Guy Steele and Richard Gabriel</a>
also stresses the importance of homoiconic notations in Lisp-based languages.

In any case,
now that
this pattern has been identified, new notations can be devised that are

<h2 id="cant-improve">Is it impossible to improve on s-expression notation?</h2>

<p>
Some Lisp developers act as if Lisp notation descended from the gods,
and thus is impossible to improve.
The authors do not agree, and instead believe that Lisp
notation <i>can</i> be improved beyond the notation created in the 1950s.
The following is a summary of a
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/readable/wiki/Retort/">retort</a>
to those who believe Lisp notation cannot be improved, based on the
claims in the
<a href="http://www.lispniks.com/faq/faq.html">Common Lisp FAQ</a> and
<a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Hopl2.pdf">
&#8220;The Evolution of Lisp&#8221; by Guy Steele and Richard Gabriel</a>.
Below are quotes from those who argue against improvement of
s-expression notation, and our replies.
</p>

<blockquote>
The Common Lisp FAQ says that people <i>&#8220;wonder why Lisp can&#8217;t
use a more &#8216;normal&#8217; syntax.
It&#8217;s not because Lispers have never thought of the idea - indeed,
Lisp was originally intended to have a syntax much like FORTRAN...&#8221;</i>.
</blockquote>
<p>
This is an argument for our position, not for theirs.
In other words, even Lisp&#8217;s creator (John McCarthy)
understood that directly using s-expressions for Lisp programs was undesirable.
No one argues that John McCarthy did not understand Lisp.
This is strong evidence that traditional s-expression notation has problems;
even Lisp&#8217;s creator thought its notation was poor.
</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Hopl2.pdf">
&#8220;The Evolution of Lisp&#8221; by Guy Steele and Richard Gabriel
(HOPL2 edition)</a> says that,
<i>&#8220;The idea of introducing Algol-like syntax into Lisp keeps popping up
and has seldom failed to create enormous controversy between those who
find the universal use of S-expressions a technical advantage (and don&#8217;t
mind the admitted relative clumsiness of S-expressions for numerical
expressions) and those who are certain that algebraic syntax is more
concise, more convenient, or even more natural...&#8221;.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that even these authors, who are advocates for s-expression notation,
admit that for numerical expressions they are clumsy.
We should also note that sweet-expressions do not try to create an
&#8220;Algol-like&#8221; syntax; sweet-expressions are entirely general
and not tied to a particular semantic at all.
</p>

<blockquote>
That paper continues,
<i>&#8220;We conjecture that Algol-style syntax has not really caught on in the
Lisp community as a whole for two reasons. First, there are not enough
special symbols to go around. When your domain of discourse is limited
to numbers or characters, there are only so many operations of interest,
and it is not difficult to assign one special character to each and
be done with it. But Lisp has a much richer domain of discourse,
and a Lisp programmer often approaches an application as yet another
exercise in language design; the style typically involves designing new
data structures and new functions to operate on them - perhaps dozens
or hundreds&#8221; and it&#8217;s just too hard to invent that many distinct
symbols (though the APL community certainly has tried). Ultimately
one must always fall back on a general function-call notation; it&#8217;s
just that Lisp programmers don&#8217;t wait until they fail.&#8221;</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
But this is a failing argument.
Practically all languages allow compound symbols made from multiple
characters, such as &gt;=; there is no shortage of symbols.
Also, nearly all programming languages have a function-call notation, but
only Lisp-based languages choose s-expressions to notate it, so
saying &#8220;we need function call notation&#8221;
do not excuse s-expressions.
You do not need legions of special syntactic constructs;
sweet-expressions allow developers to express anything that can be
expressed with s-expressions, without being tied to a particular
semantic or requiring a massive set of special symbols.
</p>

<blockquote>
Then it said,
<i>
&#8220;Second, and
perhaps more important, Algol-style syntax makes programs look less
like the data structures used to represent them. In a culture where the
ability to manipulate representations of programs is a central paradigm,
a notation that distances the appearance of a program from the appearance
of its representation as data is not likely to be warmly received (and
this was, and is, one of the principal objections to the inclusion
of loop in Common Lisp).&#8221;
</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here Steele and Gabriel are <b>extremely</b> insightful.
Today we would say that s-expressions are &#8220;homoiconic&#8221;,
and that is a rare trait among programming notations.
This property, homoiconicity, is an important reason that
Lisps are still used decades after their development.
Steele and Gabriel are absolutely right; there have been many efforts
to create readable Lisp formats, and they all failed because they
did not create formats that accurately represented the programs as
data structures.
A key and distinguishing advantage of a Lisp-like language is that
you can treat code as data, and data as code.
Any notation that makes
this difficult means that you lose many of Lisp&#8217;s unique advantages.
Homoiconicity is critical if you&#8217;re going to treat a program as data.
To do so, you must be able to easily &#8220;see&#8221;
the program&#8217;s format.
If you can, you can do amazing manipulations.
</p>
<p>
But what Gabriel and Steele failed to appreciate in their paper is that
it&#8217;s possible to have both.
Now that we understand why past efforts failed, we can devise notations
that keep these key properties (generality and homoiconicity) - and succeed!
</p>

<p>
Many people have noted that there are tools to help deal with s-expressions,
but this misses the point.
If the notation is so bad that you need tools to deal with it,
it would be better to fix the notation.
The resulting notation could be easier to read, and you could focus your
tools on solving problems that were not self-inflicted.
In particular, &#8220;stopping to see the parentheses&#8221; is a sign of a
serious problem - the placement of parentheses fundamentally affects
interpretation, and serious bugs can hide there.
</p>
<p>
Others who have used Lisp for years,
such as <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arcll1.html">Paul Graham</a>,
see s-expressions as long-winded, and advocate for the use of
&#8220;abbreviations&#8221; that can map down to an underlying s-expression notation.
Sweet-expressions take this approach.
</p>
<h2 id="why-indent">Why should indentation be syntactically relevant?</h2>

<p>
Making indentation syntactically meaningful eliminates many
parentheses, eliminating the need for humans to keep track of them.
Real Lisp programs are already indented anyway;
currently tools (like editors and pretty-printers) are used to try to
keep the indentation (used by humans) and parentheses (used by
the computers) in sync.
By making the indentation (which humans depend on)
actually used by the computer as well,
they are automatically kept in sync.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.gregslepak.com/on-lisps-readability">On
Lisp&#8217;s Readability and Parenthesis Stacking</a>
shows one of the many examples of endless closing parentheses and brackets to
close an expression, and the confusion that happens when indentation does
not match the parentheses. bhurt&#8217;s response to that article is telling:
&#8220;I&#8217;m always somewhat amazed by the claim that the parens
&#8216;just disappear&#8217;, as if this is a good thing.
Bugs live in the difference between the code in your head and the code on the
screen - and having the parens in the wrong place causes bugs.
And autoindenting isn&#8217;t the answer - I don&#8217;t want the
indenting to follow the parens, I want the parens to follow the indenting.
The indenting I can see, and can see is correct.&#8221;</p>

<p>An IDE can help keep the
indentation consistent with the parentheses, but
<a href="http://www.recursivity.com/blog/2012/10/28/ides-are-a-language-smell/">needing IDEs to use a language</a>
is considered by some a language smell.
If you need special
tools to work around problems with the notation, then the notation itself
is a problem.</p>

<p>A solution, of course, is to make the indentation
actually matter: Now you don&#8217;t need an endless march of parentheses, and
indentation can&#8217;t be confusing because it is actually used.</p>

<p>&#8220;In
praise of mandatory indentation...&#8221; notes that it can be <em>helpful</em>
to have mandatory indentation:</p>
<blockquote> <p>It hurts me to say
that something so shallow as requiring a few extra spaces can have
a bigger effect than, say, Hindley-Milner type inference.

</blockquote>

<p>Other languages,
including Python, Haskell, Occam, and Icon, use indentation to indicate
structure, so this is a proven idea.  Other recently-developed languages
like <a href="http://cobralang.com/docs/python/" rel="nofollow">Cobra</a>
(a variant of Python with strong compile-time typechecking) have
decided to use indentation too, so clearly indentation-sensitive
languages are considered useful by many.</p>

<p>
One problem with intentation as syntactically relevant is that some
transports drop leading space and tab characters.
As discussed in the
<a href="#indentation-characters">indentation characters</a> section,
we have solved this as well.
</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of
past work on indentation to represent s-expressions.
Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul Graham (developer of Arc) is known to
be an advocate of indentation for this purpose.  As I noted above, <a
href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2002-January/000666.html"
rel="nofollow">Kragen Sitaker&#8217;s notes on Graham and Arc</a>
discusses how indentation can really help (in this notation,
functions with no parameters need to be surrounded by parentheses, to
distinguish them from atoms - &#8220;oh well&#8221; ).  Graham&#8217;s <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTML" rel="nofollow">RTML</a> is
implemented using Lisp, but uses indentation instead of parentheses to
define structure.  RTML is a proprietary programming language that at
least <em>was</em> used by Yahoo!&#8217;s Yahoo! Store and Yahoo! Site
hosting products (though Yahoo may have transitioning away from it).

<li><a href="http://www.accesscom.com/~darius/">Darius Bacon&#8217;s

implementation of an indentation approach.  Bacon&#8217;s syntax for indenting
uses colons in a way that is limiting (it interferes with other uses
of the colon in various Lisp-like languages).</li>

SRFI-49, I-expressions</a> - which are discussed next.
</ul>

<h2 id="srfi-49">What is the relationship between sweet-expressions and SRFI-49 (I-expressions)?</h2>

<p>The sweet-expression indentation system is based on
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/srfi-49.html">Scheme
SRFI-49 (&#8220;surfi-49&#8221;), aka I-expressions</a>.
The basic rules of SRFI-49
(I-expression) indentation are kept in sweet-expressions; these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An indented line is a parameter of its parent.</li>
<li>Later terms on a line are parameters of the first term.</li>
<li>A line with exactly one term, and no child lines,
is simply that term; multiple terms are wrapped into a list.</li>
<li>A line beginning with an abbreviation (such as <tt>&#39;</tt>),
followed by space or tab, abbreviates the rest of the expression.
</ul>

<p>These basic rules seem fairly intuitive and do not take long to learn.
We&#8217;re grateful to the SRFI-49 author for his work, and at first, we just
used SRFI-49 directly.</p>

<p>
However, SRFI-49 turned out to have problems in practice when
we tried to use it seriously.
For example,
in SRFI-49, leading blank lines could produce the empty list <tt>()</tt>
instead of being ignored,
limiting the use of blank lines and leading to easy-to-create errors.
As specified, a SRFI-49 expression would never complete
until after the next expressions&#8217;s first line was entered, making
interactive use extremely unpleasant.
Lines with just spaces and tabs would be considered different from blank
lines, creating another opportunity for difficult-to-find errors.
The symbol <tt>group</tt> is given a special meaning, which is
inconsistent with the rest of Lisp
(where only punctuation has special syntactic meanings).
The mechanism for escaping the <tt>group</tt> symbol was confusing.
There were also a number of defects in both its
specification and implementation.
</p>

<p>
Thus, based on experience and experimentation we made several
changes to it.
First, we fixed the problems listed above.
We also addressed supporting other capabilities, namely,
infix notation and allowing formats like <tt>f(x)</tt>.
We also found that certain constructs were somewhat ugly if indentation
is required, so we added SUBLIST and SPLIT capabilities.
</p>

<p>
The very existence of SRFI-49 shows that others believe
there is value in using syntactically-significant indentation.
We are building on the experience of others to create what we hope
is a useful and refined notation.
</p>

<h2 id="separate-105">Why are sweet-expressions separate from curly-infix and neoteric-expressions as defined in SRFI-105?</h2>
<p>
Some Scheme users and implementers may not want indentation-sensitive
syntax, or may not want to accept any change that could change the
interpretation of a legal (though poorly-formatted) s-expression.
For those users and implementers, SRFI-105 adds
infix support and neoteric-expressions such as <tt>f(x)</tt>, but
only within curly braces {...}, which are not defined by the Scheme
specification anyway.
SRFI-105 makes it easier to describe the &#8220;leaves&#8221; of an
s-expression tree.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, sweet-expressions extend SRFI-105 by
making it easier to describe the larger
structure of an s-expression.
It does this by treating indentation (which is usually
present anyway) as syntactically relevant.
Sweet-expressions also allow neoteric-expressions
outside any curly braces.
By making sweet-expressions a separate tier,
people can adopt curly-infix if they don&#8217;t
want indentation to have a syntactic meaning
or want to ensure that <tt>f(x)</tt> is interpreted as two separate
datums (<tt>f</tt> and <tt>(x)</tt>).
</p>

<h2 id="blank-lines">Blank lines</h2>

<p>In sweet-expressions, a blank line
always terminates a datum, once an expression has started;
if (another) expression has not started, blank lines are ignored.
That means that in a REPL,
once you&#8217;ve entered a complete expression,
&#8220;Enter Enter&#8221; will always end it.
The &#8220;blank
lines at the beginning are ignored&#8221; rule eliminates a usability problem
with the original SRFI-49 (I-expression) spec, in which two sequential
blank lines before an expression surprisingly returned ().
This was a serious usability problem.
The sample
implementation <em>did</em> end expressions on a blank line - the problem
was that the spec didn&#8217;t clearly capture this.</p>

<p>
Allowing a blank line to end an expression
represents a trade-off between REPL use and use in a file.
In a file, a top-level expression could be determined simply by noting
that the next expression began on the left column.
But this would be hideous to use in a REPL, because it would mean
that the results of an expression would only be evaluated after the
first (and possibly only) line of the next expression was entered.
(Early Pascal I/O implementations had similar problems.)
One solution is to have a special text marker that means &#8220;done&#8221;
(e.g., &#8220;.&#8221; on a line by itself), but this makes interactive use
much less pleasant, since users then have to repeatedly
type the special &#8220;end-of-expression&#8221; marker.
Sweet-expressions do allow quick execution of one-line commands by
typing an indent character first, but users will often not know exactly
how long an expression will be until it is done, so this does not
help enough.
In contrast, pressing Enter twice is quite easy (since the user&#8217;s
finger is already on Enter to press it the first time).
Thus, the blank line rule is intentionally chosen to help interactive users,
at a mild cost to non-interactive users (who then cannot use blank lines
without ending the expression).
</p>

<p>It would be possible
to have blank lines end an expression only in interactive use.
In particular, Python does this, since it
has different rules for interactive use and files.
However, this means that you couldn&#8217;t cut-and-paste files into
the REPL interpreter and use them directly.
David A. Wheeler
believes it&#8217;s important to have exactly
the same syntax in both cases in a Lisp-based system, because
in Lisp-based systems, switching between
the REPL and files is extremely common.
This would also cause confusion, since information would be interpreted
differently depending on some mode switch.
By making &#8220;Enter Enter&#8221; <em>always</em> end an expression,
this inconsistency is avoided.</p>

<p>Of course, people sometimes want to have something like
a blank line in the middle of an s-expression.
The solution is that comment-only lines
are completely ignored and not even considered blank lines.
That means you can use comment-only lines for the purpose
of separating sections in a single datum.
The indentation of comment-only lines is ignored;
that way, you don&#8217;t have to worry about
keeping them indented the same way.
We&#8217;ve found that in practice this works very well.
</p>

<p>Since a line with only indentation may look exactly identical to a
blank line, we decided to clearly state that
&#8220;a line with only indentation is an empty line&#8221;.
This eliminates some nasty usability problems that
could arise if a &#8220;blank&#8221; line
actually had some whitespace in it;
a silent error like this could be hard to debug.</p>

<h2 id="indentation-characters">Indentation characters (! as indent)</h2>
<p>Some
like to use spaces to indent; others like tabs.  Python allows either,
and SRFI-49 allows either as well - you just have to be consistent.
Sweet-expressions continues this tradition, and
is defined so that people can use what they like.
The only rule is that they must be consistent; if a line is indented with
eight spaces, the next line cannot be indented with a tab.</p>

<p>One objection that people raise about horizontal
whitespace characters is that they can get lost in many transports
(HTML readers, etc.).
In addition, sometimes there are indented groups that you&#8217;d
like to highlight; traditional whitespace indentation provides no
opportunity to highlight indented groups specially.
When discussing syntax,
users on the readable-discuss mailing list started to use characters
(initially period+space) to show where indentation occurred so that they
wouldn&#8217;t get lost or to highlight them.
Eventually, the idea was hit upon that perhaps sweet-expressions
needed to support a <em>non-whitespace</em> character for indentation.
This is highly unorthodox, but at a stroke it eliminates the complaints
some have about syntactically-important indentation (because it is
lost by some transports), and it also provides an
easy way to highlight particular indented groups.</p>

<p>At first, we tried
to use period, or period+space, as the indent, as this was vaguely
similar to its use in some tables of contents.
But period has too many
other traditional meanings in Lisp-like languages, including beginning
a number (.9), beginning a symbol (.xyz), and as a special operator to
set the cdr of a list.
Implementation of period as an indent character
is much easier if there is a way to perform two-character lookahead
(e.g., with an unread-char function),
but this is not standard in Scheme R5RS.
Eventually the &#8220;!&#8221; was selected instead; it
practically never begins a line, and if you need it, {!...} will work.
The exclamation point is much easier to implement as an indent character,
and it is also a great character for highlighting indented groups.</p>

<h2 id="disabling-indentation-processing-with-paired-characters">Disabling
indentation processing with paired characters</h2>

<p>Indentation
processing is disabled inside (...), [ ... ], and { ... }.
This was also true
of SRFI-49, and of Python, and has wonderful side-effects:</p> <ul>
<li>Indent parsing becomes very safe to use with existing code.
Pre-existing code will almost certainly start each expression with
an opening parenthesis, disabling the indentation processing it
wasn&#8217;t expecting.</li>
<li>It makes it easy to disable indentation
processing whenever it is inconvenient.  For example, it supports
dealing with text that is very close to running off the right-hand
side, or is complex to express with indentation.</li>
<li>It is similar to what other indentation-sensitive languages do, such
as Python.</li>
<li>It is a very easy rule to explain, remember, and reason about.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that infix processing by curly-infix disables indentation
processing; in practice this doesn&#8217;t seem to be a problem.</p>

<h2 id="disabling-indentation-processing-with-an-initial-indent">Disabling
indentation processing with an initial indent</h2>

<p>Initial indentation also disables indentation processing,
which also improves backward
compatibility and makes it easy to disable indentation processing where
convenient.</p>

<p>This improves backward compatibility because a program
that uses odd formatting with a different meaning for sweet-expressions
is more likely to have initial indents.
Even if this is not
true, it&#8217;s trivially easy to add an initial indent on oddly-formatted
old files. This provides a trivial escape, making it easy to support
old files.  Then even if you have ancient code with odd formatting,
it would be likely to still &#8220;just work&#8221;
if there is any initial indentation.
We&#8217;d like this reader to be a drop-in replacement for read(),
so minimizing incompatibilities is important.</p>

<p>There is a risk that this
indentation will be accidental (e.g., a user might enter a blank line in
the middle of a routine and then start the next line indented).  However,
this is less likely to happen interactively (users can typically see
something happened immediately), and editors can easily detect and show
where surprising indentation is occurring (e.g., through highlighting),
so this risk appears to be minimal.</p>

<p>Disabling on initial indent
also deals with a subtle potential problem in implementation.
In a reader implementation, if we tried to just accept some indentation
of the first line and use it as the starting point, we create problems.
Typically readers return a whole value once that value has been
determined, and in many cases it&#8217;s tricky to store state (such as that
new indentation value) for an arbitrary port.  By disabling indentation
processing, we eliminate the need to store such state, as well as giving
users a useful tool.</p>

<p>Since this latter point isn&#8217;t obvious, here&#8217;s
a little more detailed explanation.  Obviously, to make indentation
syntactically meaningful, you need to know where an expression indents,
and where it ends. If you read in a line, and it has the same indentation
level, that should end the previous expression. If its indentation is
<em>less</em>, it should close out all the lines with deeper or equal
indentation.  But we&#8217;re trying to <em>minimize</em> the changes to the
underlying language, and in particular, we don&#8217;t want to change the &#8220;read&#8221;
interface and we&#8217;re not assuming arbitrary amounts of unread-char.
Scheme R5RS, for example, doesn&#8217;t have a standard unread-char
at all.  So let&#8217;s say you are trying to read the following:</p>
<pre>
! ! foo
! ! ! bar
! ! eggs
! ! cheese
</pre>
<p>You might expect this to
return three datums: (foo bar), eggs, and cheese. It won&#8217;t, in a typical
implementation; here&#8217;s why:
<ul>
<li>
In the first read(), it reads foo, bar, and it
consumes the indentation of &#8220;eggs&#8221; so that it can determine that another
is at the same level. It returns (foo bar).</li>
<li>In the second read(), it reads
eggs with NO indentation, because the indentation was consumed by the
first read() so it could determine when it was finished. It then reads
the indentation of cheese, which has an indentation more than zero. It
returns (eggs cheese), and we&#8217;ve consumed it all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have unlimited unread-char, there is no problem, just
unconsume characters once you&#8217;ve found the end. But many Lisps don&#8217;t have
that.</li>
<li>Read could store indentation state associated with the
port. But the user could call other routines, and a naive implementation
would read the wrong values. You&#8217;d have to re-wrap the entire I/O system
if you really wanted to be able to undo the indentation reliably. That
creates a complicated implementation that is likely to be unreliable,
and it&#8217;s lousy for performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>So for all the reasons
above, initial indent disables indentation processing for that line.</p>

<h2 id="grouping-and-splicing">Grouping and splicing (\\)</h2>
<p>SFRI-49
had a mechanism for defining lists of lists,
using the symbol &#8220;group&#8221;.
This was a valuable contribution, since there needs to be <em>some</em>
way to show lists of lists.
</p>
<p>
But after use, it was determined that having
an alphabetic symbol being used to indicate a special abbreviation was
a mistake.
All other syntactically-special abbreviations in Lisp are
written using punctuation; having one that was not was confusing.
This symbol is still called the GROUP symbol,
and happens at the start of a line (after indentation)... it is
just now respelled as \\.</p>
<p>
For example, this GROUP symbol
makes it easy to handle multiple variables in a
<tt>let</tt> expression:
</p>
<pre>
let*
  \\
    variable1 my(value1)
    variable2 my(value2)
  do-stuff1 variable1
  do-stuff2 variable1 variable2
</pre>

<p>A different problem is that sometimes you&#8217;d
like to have a set of parameters,
where they are at the &#8220;same level&#8221; but
writing them as indented parameters takes up too much vertical space.
An obvious example is keywords in various Lisps; having to write this
is painful:
</p>
<pre>
foo
  keyword1:
  parameter1
  keyword2:
  parameter2
  ....
</pre>
<p>
David A. Wheeler created an early splicing proposal. After much discussion, to solve the latter problem, the SPLIT symbol was created, so that you could do:
</p>
<pre>
foo
  keyword1: \\ parameter1
  keyword2: \\ parameter2
  ....
</pre>

<p>At first the symbol \ was used for SPLIT, but this
would cause serious problem on Lisps that supported slashification.
After long discussion, the symbol \\ was decided on for both; although
the number of characters in the underlying symbol could vary (depending on
whether or not slashification was used), this was irrelevant and seemed to
work everywhere.  By using the same symbol for both GROUP and SPLIT, we
reduced the number of different symbols that users needed to escape.</p>

<p>We dropped the SRFI-49 method for escaping the symbol by repeating
it (group group); the {} escape mechanism is more regular, and
makes it far more obvious that some special escape is going on.</p>

<h2 id="initial-group-mean-nothing">Why does initial \\ mean nothing
if there are datums afterwards on the same line?</h2>
<p>Since &#8220;let&#8221; occurs in many programs,
it would have been possible to define \\ to allow this:</p>
<pre>
let
! \\ var1 $ bar x
! !  var2 $ quux x
! nitz var1 var2
</pre>
<p>
We discussed this, but after long discussion we decided on a defined semantic that means that &#8220;\\&#8221; is an empty symbol, making that expression exactly the same as:
</p>
<pre>
let
! var1 $ bar x
! !  var2 $ quux x
! nitz var1 var2
</pre>

<p>We did this
intentionally.  It turns out that there are situations where you want a \\
as an empty symbol, even when text follows it on the line.  An example is
arc&#8217;s if-then-else, where there are <em>logically</em> pairs of items,
but from a <em>list</em> semantic are at the same level. E.G.:</p>
<pre>
if
! condition1()
! \\ action1()
! condition2()
! \\ action2()
! \\ otherwise-action()
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to handle let* with an extra line, but there&#8217;s
no easy way to insert a short pseudo-comment character in the front unless
we do it this way.</p>
<p>The multi-line nature of let* turns out to be
not a real problem, for 2 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It turns out that in many
&#8220;let*s&#8221; the variable settings can be put on one line. As of 2012-08-02 the
&#8220;sweeten.sscm&#8221; has 305 non-blank, non-comment lines
(as determined by <tt>grep -v '^$' sweeten.sscm | grep -v '^ *;' | wc -l</tt>).
Of those, 13 lines use let or let*, and only one of those &#8220;lets&#8221; uses \\.
It&#8217;s not worth optimizing a case that only happens approximately once in
300 lines.</li>
<li>
Using the abbreviations as intended is REALLY
clear, even though it uses an extra vertical line.
</li>
</ol>
<p>So the savings for <em>let</em> aren&#8217;t significant, the
semantics as designed are clear, and are intentionally using that
notation for another purpose where it&#8217;s not as easy to use an
alternative.</p>

<h2 id="traditional-abbreviations">Traditional abbreviations</h2>

<p>As with SRFI-49, a leading traditional
abbreviation (quote, comma, backquote, or comma-at), followed by space
or tab, is that operator applied to the sweet-expression starting at the
same line.
This makes it easy to abbreviations to complex indented structures.
For example, a complex indented structure can be
quoted simply by prefixing a single quote and space.</p>

<h2 id="sublist">Sublist ($)</h2>

<p>Alan Manuel Gloria
noted that certain constructs were common and annoying to express,
e.g., first(second(third(fourth))), and based on Haskell experience,
suggested being able to write them as first $ second $ third(fourth).
Again, the idea is that this is an abbreviation for a common-enough
practice.</p>

<p>This is another example (like GROUP/SPLIT) of a
construct that, when you need it, is incredibly useful.
It&#8217;s not
all that unusual to have a few processing or cleanup functions that
take a single argument, and for all the &#8220;real work&#8221; to be nested
in something else.
This would require several levels of indentation
without sublist, but they are easily handled with sublist.
</p>
<p>
An example is
scsh, which has functions like &#8220;run&#8221; that are applied to
another list.
With sublist, this is easily expressed.
For example, here&#8217;s a sweet-expression using scsh:
<pre>
  run $ grep -i "xx.*zz" &lt;(oldfile) &gt;(newfile)
</pre>


<p>After discussion, sublist was accepted in July 2012.</p>

<h2 id="reserved">Reserved markers</h2>
<p>
The markers &lt;* and *&gt; are reserved for future use.
These may, at some point, have the following syntax
as described in an
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/readable-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00806.html">email posted 2012-09-02</a>:

<blockquote>
<i>
&lt;* ... *&gt; are like ( ... ) in that they surround a list,
but they do NOT turn 
off indentation processing.
A &#8220;&lt;*&#8221; resets the &#8220;indent&#8221; level to a 0-length 
string, skips all horizontal whitespace, and then restarts reading an 
expression with indentation processing still live.
A blank line inside &lt;* ... 
*&gt; ends an expression WITHIN the &lt;* ... *&gt;,
but stays within &lt;* ... *&gt;; only 
eof or active *&gt; can close the &lt;*.
Once all that mapping is done, the range of 
&lt;* ... *&gt; is replaced with the mapped result.
</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
These markers may be very useful in the future, e.g., for let expressions.
However, we have not included them at this time, because
these markers can complicate processing.
Other markers can be read and handled with one-character lookahead, and
cause a simple return in some cases.
However, processing the closing *&gt; requires potentially a return up
multiple levels, which requires a different implementation approach than
is otherwise required.
It is also unclear that this is really necessary, and we are hesitant
to add yet more syntax beyond the <tt>$</tt> and <tt>\\</tt> markers.
</p>

<p>
The marker <tt>$$$</tt> is also reserved for potential future use.
No particular semantics for this symbol are agreed on.
It could be used in the future to implement ENLIST,
an older proposed semantic where if it occurs at the beginning of a line,
it immediately inserts a list level,
regardless of whether it is by itself or with other elements on the line.
Another speculative semantic (that has not yet been
significantly discussed) might be to implement the following kind of mapping:
</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Original</th><th>Maps to</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
let $$$ var1 initial(value1)
  expression1()
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
(let ((var1 (initial value1)))
  (expression1))
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<pre>
let
  $$$ var1 initial(value1)
      var2 initial(value2)
  expression1()
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
(let
  ((var1 (initial value1))
   (var2 (initial value2)))
  (expression1))
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>
These mappings are not required in sweet-expression implementations,
but it seems prudent to have a few symbols available for future expansion.
Thus, the symbols <tt>&lt;*</tt>, <tt>*&gt;</tt>, and <tt>$$$</tt>
must be escaped (e.g., using {...}) if they are used in an
indentation-processing context.
</p>

<h2 id="semicolon">Special semicolon values</h2>

<p>
As described in the specification,
a tool that reads sweet-expressions and writes out
s-expressions <em>SHOULD</em> specially treat certain lines
that begin with semicolons.
</p>

<p>
The semicolon + whitespace rule is given so some comments - particularly
the ones about major new components -
are likely to be included in a translation from sweet-expressions to
s-expressions (namely, any comments that precede an expression).
This can greatly simplify examining the generated s-expression.
the rules about ";#", ";!", and ";_"
make it easier to write shell scripts and similar constructs
with embedded sweet-expressions; these
lines can invoke some Scheme interpreter, possibly via a shell.
</p>

<p>
This text is limited to only apply to lines outside of any sweet-expression.
This is intentional, because this makes implementation easy
on top of an existing existing sweet-expression reader.
The top-level tool can simply see if a line begins with semicolon, and if
it does, handle it specially;
if a line starts with any other character, it can call the sweet-expression
reader to handle it.
There is no requirement to copy block comments, or comments inside
a sweet-expression datum, because this would be much more complicated to do;
handling block comments is non-trivial functionality that a sweet-expression
reader must perform, and there is no standard way to return comments
inside a datum.
Semicolon comments immediately after a datum need not be copied or
processed specially, because a sweet-expression reader
has to consume them to see if it's reached the end of the datum.
A Scheme implementation with unlimited unread could do more with relative ease,
but since many Scheme implementations do not have unlimited unread, these
limitations make implementation of such tools much simpler.
</p>

<p>
These rules are based on the <i>unsweeten</i> tool.
</p>

<h2 id="q2">Comparison to Q2</h2>
<p>An interesting
experimental notation, &#8220;Q2&#8221;, was developed by Per Bothner; see
<a href="http://per.bothner.com/blog/2010/Q2-extensible-syntax/"
rel="nofollow">http://per.bothner.com/blog/2010/Q2-extensible-syntax/</a>.
</p>
<p>Q2 has somewhat similar goals to the &#8220;readable&#8221; project, though
with a different approach. The big difference is that David A. Wheeler
decided it was important to have a generic notation for <em>any</em>
s-expression. Here is a brief additional comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sweet-expressions have infix, though not built-in precedence
(precedence can be implemented by defining <tt>$nfx$</tt>).
</li>
<li>Both have &#8220;juxtaposition for function application&#8221;</li>
<li>Q2 has
&#8220;Naming a zero-argument function applies it&#8221; but this is awkward, indeed,
&#8220;The exact rule for a distinguishing between a variable reference
and a zero-argument function application isn&#8217;t decided yet.&#8221; In
sweet-expressions, a zero-argument function name is called by adding
() after it or around it, e.g., pi().</li>
<li>&#8220;Flexible token format&#8221;
- both require operators to be delimited.</li>
<li>&#8220;Use indentation
for grouping&#8221; - both use indentation for grouping</li>
<li>&#8220;Block
expressions yield multiple values&#8221; - In sweet-expressions, you use
usual Scheme procedures, including value, instead of having special
syntax.</li>
<li>REPL: In sweet-expressions, you usually end a line
with ENTER ENTER. Q2 doesn&#8217;t, but Wheeler worries that you have to be careful
or it&#8217;ll end where it syntactically might not need to.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="p4p">Comparison to P4P</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://shriram.github.com/p4p/">
P4P: A Syntax Proposal</a> by Shriram Krishnamurthi
describes an alternative, more readable format for the Racket implementation
of Scheme.
There are some similarities, but many differences.
</p>

<p>
P4P supports functional name-prefixing such as f(x),
just as sweet-expressions do.
However, function parameters are separated by commas
(an extra character not typical in Lisp code, and in our experiments
something of a pain since parameters are very common).
P4P does not support infix notation at all, even though practically
all non-Lisp languages support them.
</p>

<p>
P4P has a very different view of indentation, compared to
sweet-expressions.
In P4P, indentation does not control semantics.
Instead,
&#8220;the semantics controls indentation: that is, each construct has
indentation rules, and the parser enforces them. However, changing the
indentation of a term either leaves the program&#8217;s meaning unchanged
or results in a syntax error; it cannot change the meaning of the
program.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
This means that P4P has a large number of special-case syntactic constructs.
For example, defvar: and deffun: specially use &#8220;=&#8221;,
if: has intermediate keywords, and so on.
While this looks nice when you stay within its set, it encounters
the same problem that McCarthy had with M-expressions: There are always
new constructs, including ones in meta-languages (not the underlying
Scheme implementation) and macros.
The P4P author notes that,
&#8220;it would be easy to add new constructs such as
provide:, test:, defconst: (to distinguish from defvar:), and so on&#8221;,
but this misses the point; the task of defining constructs
inhibits the use of those constructs, and may be impractical
if there are syntactic differences at different language levels.
For example, imagine processing lists where &#8220;deffun&#8221; has a different
definition than the underlying language; this is trivial with
s-expressions and sweet-expressions, but not practical using P4P.
</p>

<p>
The P4P author notes that, &#8220;the parser can be run in a mode where
indentation-checking is simply turned off...
This can be beneficial when dealing with program-generated code.&#8221;
However, now the developer must deal with enabling various modes,
and this mode is needed not just for program-generated code, but for
code that has mixtures of various languages.
Rather than having multiple modes, a single mode that works everywhere
seems more useful to the developers of the sweet-expression notation.
</p>

<p>
In short, P4P fails to be generic; it is tied to specific semantics.
Previous readability efforts, such as M-expressions, failed,
and we believe that one reason was that those notations
failed to be generic.
We applaud the admirable goals of P4P, but do not think it represents
the best way forward.
</p>

<p>
However, while we believe different design choices need to be made,
we applaud the effort.
In addition, we believe that
P4P is additional evidence that people are interested
in improving the readability of Lisp,
and that indentation can help do so.
</p>

<h2 id="writing-out-results">Writing out results</h2>
<p>An obvious question
is, &#8220;how do you write them out?&#8221;  After all, with these notations there is
more than one way to present expressions.</p>

<p>But no Lisp guarantees
that what it writes out is the same sequence of characters that was
written.  For example, <tt>(quote&nbsp;x)</tt>
when read might be written back
as <tt>'x</tt>, while on others, reading
<tt>'y</tt> might be printed as <tt>(quote&nbsp;y)</tt>.
Similarly, if you enter <tt>(a&nbsp;.&nbsp;(b&nbsp;.&nbsp;()))</tt>,
many Lisps will write that back as &#8220;(a&nbsp;b)&#8221;.
Nothing has fundamentally changed;
as always, you should implement your Lisp expression writer so that
it presents a format convenient to both human and machine readers.</p>

<h2 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h1>

<p>Backwards compatibility with traditional Lisp notation is helpful.
A reader that can also read traditional s-expressions, formatted
conventionally, is much easier to switch to.
</p>

<p>
The sweet-expression notation is fully backwards-compatible with
<em>well-formatted</em> Lisp s-expressions.
Thus, a user can enable sweet-expressions and continue to read and
process traditionally-formatted s-expressions as well.
If an s-expression is so badly formatted that it
would be interpreted differently, that s-expression could first be sent
through a traditional s-expression pretty-printer and have the
problem resolved.
</p>
<p>
The changes that can cause a difference in interpretation are due
to the active use of neoteric-expressions outside of {...},
unlike SRFI-105, and because of the indentation processing.
</p>
<p>
Neoteric-expressions
are compatible for what I&#8217;d call &#8220;normal&#8221; formatting.
The key issue is
that neoteric-expressions change
the meaning of an opening parenthesis, bracket, or brace
after a character other than whitespace or another opening character.
For example, <samp>a(b)</samp> becomes
the single expressions &#8220;(a&nbsp;b)&#8221; in sweet-expressions,
not the two expressions &#8220;a&#8221; followed later by &#8220;(b)&#8221;.
There are millions of lines of Lisp code that would never
see the difference.
So if you wrote &#8220;<samp>a(b)</samp>&#8221; expecting it to be
&#8220;<samp>a&nbsp;(b)</samp>&#8221;,
you will need to insert the space before the opening parenthesis.
We believe such s-expressions are poorly (and misleadingly) formatted
in the first place;
you should write
&#8220;<samp>a&nbsp;(b)</samp>&#8221; if you intend for these to be
two separate datums.
</p>
<p>
Sweet-expressions add
indentation processing, but since indentation is disabled inside (...),
and initial indentation also disables indentation processing,
ordinary Lisp expressions immediately disable indentation processing and
typically don&#8217;t cause issues.
In rare circumstances they can be interpreted differently:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a <em>top-level</em> expression
with more than one datum on a line <em>and</em> the line doesn&#8217;t begin
with space/tab, they will be interpreted differently.
Thus, at the topmost level, &#8220;<samp>(a)&nbsp;(b)</samp>&#8221;
on one line
is interpreted as two datums &#8220;<samp>(a)</samp>&#8221;
followed by &#8220;<samp>(b)</samp>&#8221; in traditional
Lisp, but this is a single &#8220;<samp>((a)&nbsp;(b))</samp>&#8221;
in sweet-expressions.
Note that this interpretation is also disabled by any indentation, so just
inserting a space on those rare lines where this occurs
<em>ensures</em> compatibility with the
sweet-expression indentation processing.
We believe that at the top level, two separate datums should be written
as two separate lines, as putting them on the same line is misleading
and confusing anyway.
</li>
<li>Sweet-expressions also count &#8220;!&#8221; at the beginning of a line as
an indent character.  This rarely causes any issue, since once you
use an open parenthesis to start an expression any this meaning for
&#8220;!&#8221; is disabled.
In addition, the first character on a line other than space, tab, or
&#8220;!&#8221; also disables this interpretation on that line.
Generally, you&#8217;d have to have a symbol whose name
<em>starts</em> with &#8220;!&#8221; before any issue could come up,
(such symbols are unusual) and then use them directly at the top level
to retrieve its value (which would also be unusual).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="experiences">Past experiences</h2>
<p>
At least two programs have been written using sweet-expressions:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net"><i>sweeten</i></a>
by David A. Wheeler is
a program that reads traditionally-formatted
s-expressions and writes sweet-expressions.
This program performs a great deal of traditional list processing, and
is part of the &#8220;readable&#8221; project&#8217;s git repository.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AmkG/letterfall"><i>letterfall</i></a>
by Alan Manuel K. Gloria is a graphical
real-time touch typing game to improve typing skills, which uses
GNOME libraries.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The SRFI authors believe that the existence of these programs -
written by two different people for different application areas -
shows that sweet-expressions are mature enough to be standardized.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net">Readable Lisp S-expressions Project</a> developed these notations and implementations of them.
In particular, the project distributes the programs
<i>unsweeten</i> (which takes sweet-expressions and transforms them
into s-expressions) and
<i>sweeten</i> (which takes s-expressions and transforms them into
sweet-expressions), as well as other related tools.

<h1><a name="reference-implementation">Reference implementation</a></h1>
<p>
??? TODO
</p>

<p>The implementation below is portable, with the exception that
Scheme provides no standard mechanism to override the built-in reader.
An implementation that complies with this SRFI must
at least activate this behavior
when they read the <code>#!sweet</code> marker
followed by whitespace.
</p>
<p>This reference implementation is SRFI type 2: &#8220;A
mostly-portable solution that uses some kind of hooks provided in
some Scheme interpreter/compiler. In this case, a detailed
specification of the hooks must be included so that the SRFI is

; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Compatibility Layer
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; The compatibility layer is composed of:
;
;   (readable-kernel-module-contents (exports ...) body ...)
;   - a macro that should package the given body as a module, or whatever your
;     scheme calls it (chicken eggs?), preferably with one of the following
;     names, in order of preference, depending on your Scheme's package naming
;     conventions/support
;       (readable kernel)
;       readable/kernel
;       readable-kernel
;       sweetimpl
;   - The first element after the module-contents name is a list of exported
;     procedures.  This module shall never export a macro or syntax, not even
;     in the future.
;   - If your Scheme requires module contents to be defined inside a top-level
;     module declaration (unlike Guile where module contents are declared as
;     top-level entities after the module declaration) then the other
;     procedures below should be defined inside the module context in order
;     to reduce user namespace pollution.
;
;   (my-peek-char port)
;   (my-read-char port)
;   - Performs I/O on a "port" object.
;   - The algorithm assumes that port objects have the following abilities:
;     * The port automatically keeps track of source location
;       information.  On R5RS there is no source location
;       information that can be attached to objects, so as a
;       fallback you can just ignore source location, which
;       will make debugging using sweet-expressions more
;       difficult.
;   - "port" or fake port objects are created by the make-read procedure
;     below.
;   
;   (make-read procedure)
;   - The given procedure accepts exactly 1 argument, a "fake port" that can
;     be passed to my-peek-char et al.
;   - make-read creates a new procedure that supports your Scheme's reader
;     interface.  Usually, this means making a new procedure that accepts
;     either 0 or 1 parameters, defaulting to (current-input-port).
;   - If your Scheme doesn't support unlimited lookahead, you should make
;     the fake port that supports 2-char lookahead at this point.
;   - If your Scheme doesn't keep track of source location information
;     automatically with the ports, you may again need to wrap it here.
;   - If your Scheme needs a particularly magical incantation to attach
;     source information to objects, then you might need to use a weak-key
;     table in the attach-sourceinfo procedure below and then use that
;     weak-key table to perform the magical incantation.
;
;   (invoke-read read port)
;   - Accepts a read procedure, which is a (most likely built-in) procedure
;     that requires a *real* port, not a fake one.
;   - Should unwrap the fake port to a real port, then invoke the given
;     read procedure on the actual real port.
;
;   (get-sourceinfo port)
;   - Given a fake port, constructs some object (which the algorithm treats
;     as opaque) to represent the source information at the point that the
;     port is currently in.
;
;   (attach-sourceinfo pos obj)
;   - Attaches the source information pos, as constructed by get-sourceinfo,
;     to the given obj.
;   - obj can be any valid Scheme object.  If your Scheme can only track
;     source location for a subset of Scheme object types, then this procedure
;     should handle it gracefully.
;   - Returns an object with the source information attached - this can be
;     the same object, or a different object that should look-and-feel the
;     same as the passed-in object.
;   - If source information cannot be attached anyway (your Scheme doesn't
;     support attaching source information to objects), just return the
;     given object.
;
;   (replace-read-with f)
;   - Replaces your Scheme's current reader.
;   - Replace 'read and 'get-datum at the minimum.  If your Scheme
;     needs any kind of involved magic to handle load and loading
;     modules correctly, do it here.
;
;   next-line
;   line-separator
;   paragraph-separator
;   - The Unicode characters with those names.
;   - If your Scheme does *not* support Unicode, define these to be #f.
;   - If your Scheme *does* support Unicode, to prevent other Schemes
;     from misreading this file, use the following defines:
;       (define next-line (integer-&gt;char #x0085))
;       (define line-separator (integer-&gt;char #x2028))
;       (define paragraph-separator (integer-&gt;char #x2029))
;
;   (parse-hash no-indent-read char fake-port)
;   - a procedure that is invoked when an unrecognized, non-R5RS hash
;     character combination is encountered in the input port.
;   - this procedure is passed a "fake port", as wrapped by the
;     make-read procedure above.  You should probably use my-read-char
;     and my-peek-char in it, or at least unwrap the port (since
;     make-read does the wrapping, and you wrote make-read, we assume
;     you know how to unwrap the port).
;   - if your procedure needs to parse a datum, invoke
;     (no-indent-read fake-port).  Do NOT use any other read procedure.  The
;     no-indent-read procedure accepts exactly one parameter - the fake port
;     this procedure was passed in.
;     - no-indent-read is either a version of curly-infix-read, or a version
;       of neoteric-read; this specal version accepts only a fake port.
;       It is never a version of sweet-read.  You don't normally want to
;       call sweet-read, because sweet-read presumes that it's starting
;       at the beginning of the line, with indentation processing still
;       active.  There's no reason either must be true when processing "#".
;   - At the start of this procedure, both the # and the character
;     after it have been read in.
;   - The procedure returns one of the following:
;       #f  - the hash-character combination is invalid/not supported.
;       ()  - the hash-character combination introduced a comment;
;             at the return of this procedure with this value, the
;             comment has been removed from the input port.
;       (a) - the datum read in is the value a
;
;   hash-pipe-comment-nests?
;   - a Boolean value that specifies whether #|...|# comments
;     should nest.
;
;   my-string-foldcase
;   - a procedure to perform case-folding to lowercase, as mandated
;     by Unicode.  If your implementation doesn't have Unicode, define
;     this to be string-downcase.  Some implementations may also
;     interpret "string-downcase" as foldcase anyway.

; Scheme Reader re-implementation
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; We have to re-implement our own Scheme reader.
; This takes more code than it would otherwise because many
; Scheme readers will not consider [, ], {, and } as delimiters
; (they are not required delimiters in R5RS and R6RS).
; Thus, we cannot call down to the underlying reader to implement reading
; many types of values such as symbols.
; If your Scheme's "read" also considers [, ], {, and } as
; delimiters (and thus are not consumed when reading symbols, numbers, etc.),
; then underlying-read could be much simpler.
; We WILL call default-scheme-read on string reading (the ending delimiter
; is ", so that is no problem) - this lets us use the implementation's
; string extensions if any.

  ; Identifying the list of delimiter characters is harder than you'd think.
  ; This list is based on R6RS section 4.2.1, while adding [] and {},
  ; but removing "#" from the delimiter set.
  ; NOTE: R6RS has "#" has a delimiter.  However, R5RS does not, and
  ; R7RS probably will not - http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/wiki/WG1Ballot3Results
  ; shows a strong vote AGAINST "#" being a delimiter.
  ; Having the "#" as a delimiter means that you cannot have "#" embedded
  ; in a symbol name, which hurts backwards compatibility, and it also
  ; breaks implementations like Chicken (has many such identifiers) and
  ; Gambit (which uses this as a namespace separator).
  ; Thus, this list does NOT have "#" as a delimiter, contravening R6RS
  ; (but consistent with R5RS, probably R7RS, and several implementations).
  ; Also - R7RS draft 6 has "|" as delimiter, but we currently don't.

Notes on HTML 3.2:
* HTML 3.2 has no attribute "id", so we use <a name="ID">...</a> instead.
* HTML 3.2 doesn't include CSS "style", so a table is is used to format
  the curly-infix list BNF.
* HTML 3.2 lacks many named entities, so we use numbered entities.
  Although HTML 3.2 includes a mechanism to define new entities inline
  (as part of the DOCTYPE), this is not supported by more modern
  systems (e.g., Firefox).  In contrast, *EVERYONE* supports HTML
  numbered entities.
* The character ' is fine in HTML and XML, but the "quoter" tool
  (that automatically convert single and double quotes into curly quotes)
  will convert them.  That's fine for constructs like "doesn't", but
  is wrong when referring to Scheme's "quote" abbreviation.
  A useful solution is to represent it as an HTML entity.
  The named entity &apos; is in XML 1.0 and HTML 4.0, but not in HTML 3.2,
  so we cannot use "&apos;" to represent it.  Instead, this file
  uses &#39; for single vertical apostrophe.  That way, it will
  not be converted later to curly quotes by "quoter" and similar tools.
* HTML 3.2 doesn't allow <style...> in the head; but this is
  commonly-implemented, and implementations that don't will just
  back off to a less-pretty format.
* HTML 3.2 doesn't allow <div> to declare a class, but this is
  widely implemented, and helpful for the CSS.  Systems that
  don't implement it can trivially back off of it.
