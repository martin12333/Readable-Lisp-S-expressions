<h1><a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>
Many software developers find Lisp s-expression notation inconvient and
unpleasant to read.
Even those who like Lisp s-expressions typically use indentation
to show structure, because structure is not obvious
in raw un-indented s-expressions.
An alternative syntax for structure, used in some languages such as Python,
is to make indentation syntactically important.
Indentation-sensitive syntax eliminates
the need for many parentheses, and it also eliminates the need
to synchronize indentation with parentheses.
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/">SRFI-49</a> defines an
indentation-sensitive syntax, but in practice is somewhat awkward,
and by itself it lacks the
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-105/">SRFI-105</a>
support for infix notation (e.g., <tt>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b}</tt>)
and prefix formats (e.g., <tt>f(x)</tt>).
</p>
<p>
This SRFI defines sweet-expressions (aka t-expressions),
an indentation-sensitive syntax developed from
experience in implementing real Scheme programs.
It is derived from
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/">SRFI-49</a>
and includes (by reference)
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-105/">SRFI-105</a>.
The sweet-expression notation is
generic (the notation does not depend on an underlying semantic),
homoiconic (the underlying data structure is clear from the syntax), and
backwards-compatible with well-formatted s-expressions.
</p>
<p>
For example, the following sweet-expression:
</p>
<pre>
define factorial(n)
  if {n <= 1}
    1
    {n * factorial{n - 1}}
</pre>
<p>
Maps to the following sweet-expression:
</p>
<pre>
(define (factorial n)
  (if (<= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
</pre>

<p>Note that this is derived from the
&#8220;<a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net/">readable</a>&#8221;
project.
</p>

<h1><a name="rationale">Rationale</a></h1>
<p>
The large number of parentheses required by Lisp syntax is the butt
of many jokes in the software development community.
The
<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/L/LISP.html">Jargon File</a>
says that Lisp is
&#8220;mythically from &#8216;Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses&#8217; &#8220;.
<a href="http://fortunes.cat-v.org/kernelnewbies/">Linus Torvalds</a>
commented about some parentheses-rich C code,
&#8220;don&#8217;t ask me about the extraneous parenthesis.  I bet some
LISP programmer felt alone and decided to make it a bit more homey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Since Lisp programs and data are often written using indentation anyway,
it seems reasonable to create
an indentation-sensitive syntax that would eliminate the need for
many of these &#8220;superfluous&#8221; parentheses, as well as eliminating the
need to keep the indentation and parentheses synchronized.
</p>
<p>
This indentation-sensitive syntax
is generic (the notation does not depend on an underlying semantic)
and homoiconic (the underlying data structure is clear from the syntax).
We believe previous efforts to improve the readability of
Lisp s-expressions, such as McCarthy&#8217;s M-expressions, failed because
they failed to be generic or homoiconic.
It often difficult to easily access new capabilities
(such as those defined by macros) in notations that are not
generic or homoiconic.
In contrast, because sweet-expressions <i>are</i> generic and homoiconic,
they can be easily used with other constructs
such as quasiquoting and macros.
In short, if a capability can be accessed using s-expressions, then they
can be accessed without any additional effort using sweet-expressions.
The indentation processing is simply
an abbreviation, in much the same way that
<samp>&#39;x</samp> is an abbreviation for <samp>(quote&nbsp;x)</samp>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/">SRFI-49</a> defines an
indentation-sensitive syntax, but
it has not been widely deployed among Scheme implementations
because of its various problems and limitations.
For example,
in SRFI-49, leading blank lines could produce the empty list <tt>()</tt>
instead of being ignored,
limiting the use of blank lines and leading to easy-to-create errors.
As specified, a SRFI-49 expression would never complete
until after the next expressions&#8217;s first line was entered, making
interactive use extremely unpleasant.
Lines with just spaces and tabs would be considered different from blank
lines, creating another opportunity for difficult-to-find errors.
The symbol <tt>group</tt> is given a special meaning, which is
inconsistent with the rest of Lisp
(where only punctuation has special syntactic meanings).
There were also a number of defects in both its
specification and implementation.
Nevertheless, SRFI-49 represented an important first step in devising
an indentation-sensitive syntax; sweet-expressions are derived from SRFI-49
and retain most of its syntax.
</p>
<p>
The notation defined in this sweet-expressions SRFI
is intentionally designed so that, unlike Python,
it works exactly the same way in both interactive mode (e.g., a REPL)
and when processing a file.
A difference in modes could cause failure when
cutting-and-pasting between a file and an interactive session.
Since many users often switch between the REPL and files,
such a difference was considered unacceptable.
</p>
<p>This notation is a <em>simple</em> and
<em>straightforward</em> technique, extended by a few abbreviations
based on real-world experience.

<p>
See the <a href="#design-rationale">design rationale</a> for a detailed
discussion on how and why it is designed this way.

The key words
&#8220;<em>MUST</em>&#8221;,

<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>.
</p>

<p>
<p>&#8220;<dfn>Sweet-expressions</dfn>&#8221; (aka &#8220;<dfn>t-expressions</dfn>&#8221;) deduce parentheses from indentation.
A sweet-expression reader <em>MUST</em> interpret its input
as follows when indentation processing is active:
<ol>
<li>An indented line is a parameter of its parent.</li>
<li>Later terms on a line are parameters of the first term.</li>
<li>A line with exactly one term, and no child lines, is simply that term; multiple terms are wrapped into a list.</li>
<li>An empty line ends the expression; empty lines before expressions are ignored.</li>
<li>Indentation processing is not active (and thus does not occur) inside ( ), [ ], and { }, whether they are prefixed or not; they&#8217;re just neoteric-expressions.</li>
<li>Terms are neoteric-expressions as defined in
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-105/">SRFI-105</a>.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Sweet-expression rule clarifications:
<ol>
<li>You can indent using one-or-more space, tab, and/or exclamation point (!)
characters.</li>
<li>Lines with only a ;-comment (preceded by 0 or more indent characters)
are completely ignored - even their indentation (if any) is irrelevant.</li>
<li>A line with only indentation is an empty line.</li>
<li>An expression that starts indented enables &#8220;indented-compatibility&#8221; mode,
where indentation is completely ignored.
Instead, a sequence of white-space separated neoteric-expressions is read
until the first end of line or end of file.</li>
<li>Scheme&#8217;s #; datum comment comments out the next neoteric expression,
not the next sweet expression.</li>
<li>??? Discuss #| ... |#.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The sweet-expression advanced features are defined as follows:
<ol>
<li>A \\ (aka SPLIT) <em>MUST</em> start a new line at the current indentation. If it&#8217;s immediately after indentation (aka GROUP in that case), it represents no symbol at all (at that indentation) - this is useful for lists of lists.</li>
<li>A $ (aka SUBLIST) in the middle of list <em>MUST</em> restart list processing; the right-hand-side (including its sub-blocks) is the last parameter of the left-hand side (of just that line). If there&#8217;s no left-hand-side, the right-hand-side is put in a list.</li>
<li>A leading traditional abbreviation (quote, comma, backquote, or comma-at), followed by space or tab, <em>MUST</em> be interpreted as that operator applied to the sweet-expression that follows.</li>
<li>The markers &lt;* and *&gt; are reserved for future use.
</ol>

<p>
The markers for the advanced sweet-expression features <em>MUST</em>
only be accepted as such when indentation processing is active,
and <em>MUST</em> only be
interpreted as above if they begin with their characters as shown.
For example, <samp><tt>{$}</tt></samp>
<em>MUST NOT</em> be interpreted as the SUBLIST marker; instead, it
<em>MUST</em> be interpreted as the symbol <tt>$</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Beginning an expression with indentation <em>MUST</em> cause that line&#8217;s
indentation to be ignored, improving backwards compatibility. We recommend
that editors highlight these lines as warnings, to reduce the risk of
their accidental use. It might be also useful for an editor to highlight
blank lines (as they separate expressions) and lines beginning at the
left column (as these start new expressions).
</p>

<p>A <dfn>sweet-expression reader</dfn> is a datum reader
that can correctly read and map sweet-expressions as defined above
(including the advanced sweet-expression features).
An implementation of this SRFI <em>MUST</em> accept
the marker <code>#!sweet</code> followed by a whitespace character
in its standard datum readers (e.g., <code>read</code> and, if applicable,
the default implementation REPL).
This marker (including the trailing whitespace character)
<em>MUST</em> be consumed and considered whitespace.
After reading this marker, the reader <em>MUST</em> accept
sweet-expressions in subsequent datums read from the same port,
overriding any conflicting marker (such as <code>#!curly-infix</code>
followed by whitespace)
until some other conflicting marker is given.
</p>

<p>
Implementations of this SRFI <em>MAY</em>
implement curly-infix-expressions in their datum readers by default,
even when the marker is not (yet) received.
Portable applications <em>SHOULD</em> include this marker before
using curly-infix-expressions, typically near the top of a file.
Portable applications <em>SHOULD NOT</em>
use this marker as the very first characters
of a file (e.g., it could be preceded by a newline),
because they might be misinterpreted on some platforms
as an executable script header.
</p>

<p>
Implementations <em>MAY</em> provide the procedure
<var>sweet-read</var> as a
sweet-expression reader.
If provided, this procedure
<em>SHOULD</em> support an optional port parameter.
</p>

<p>Note that, by definition, this SRFI modifies lexical syntax.</p>

<h1><a name="design-rationale">Design Rationale</a></h1>

<p>
??? TODO
</p>

<p>
This SRFI design
rationale is unusually long, especially when you compare it to
the simplicity of its specification.
We have separated the design rationale from the overall rationale,
as was previously done by SRFI-26, because it is easier to
understand the design rationale after reading the specification.
</p>

<h2>General and homoiconic formats</h2>

<p>There have been a huge number of past efforts
to create readable formats for Lisp-based languages,
going all the way back to the original
M-expression syntax that Lisp&#8217;s creator expected to be used when
programming.  Generally, they&#8217;ve been unsuccessful, or they end up
creating a completely different language that lacks the advantages
of Lisp-based languages.
</p>

<p>
After examining a huge number of them,
David A. Wheeler noticed a pattern: Past &#8220;readable&#8221; Lisp notations
typically failed to be <em>general</em> or <em>homoiconic</em>.
</p>

<p>
A <em>general</em>
format is <em>not</em> tied to some specific underlying semantic.
Most readability efforts focused on creating special syntax for each
language construct of an underlying language.  But since Lisp-based
languages can trivially create new semantic constructs (via macros), and
are often used to process fragments of <em>other</em> languages, these
did not work well.  It was often difficult to keep updating the parser to
match the underlying system, so the parser was always less capable than
using s-expressions... leading to its abandonment.  Sometimes the parser
was continuously maintained, but soon the parser led to the development
of a completely new language that was less suitable for self-analysis
of program fragments and similar tasks (and thus no longer a suitable
&#8220;Lisp&#8221;).
It&#8217;s easy to create a new &#8220;operator&#8221; in a Lisp, yet many
infix systems cannot work without having its precedence predefined.
Similarly, it&#8217;s easy to create a macro in Lisp, and using it must not
require that the parser be changed each time.
</p>
<p>
A <em>homoiconic</em> format is a surface format in which the <em>human</em>
reader can easily determine what the underlying representation is.
It is very difficult to take advantage of Lisp capabilities, such as
macros, without a homoiconic format. Yet many past readability efforts
made it difficult to determine exactly what structures were being
created by the notation.  Typical infix notations with precedence were
especially common examples of this problem - they would quietly create
multiple lists without obvious indications that this was happening.
<a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/tdop/tdop.html">
Top Down Operator Precedence by Douglas Crockford
(2007-02-21)</a>, for example, discusses Vaughan Pratt&#8217;s &#8220;Top Down
Operator Precedence&#8221; and shows how important homoiconicity is.
He stated that &#8220;parsing techniques are not greatly valued in the
LISP community, which celebrates the Spartan denial of syntax.
There
have been many attempts since LISP&#8217;s creation to give the language a
rich ALGOL-like syntax, including Pratt&#8217;s CGOL, LISP 2, MLISP, Dylan,
Interlisp&#8217;s Clisp, and McCarthy&#8217;s original M-expressions. All failed
to find acceptance. That community found the correspondence between
programs and data to be much more valuable than expressive syntax. But
the mainstream programming community likes its syntax, so LISP has
never been accepted by the mainstream.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Now that
this pattern has been identified, new notations can be devised that are
general and homoiconic - avoiding the problems of past efforts.</p>

<p>See

<h2>It is impossible to improve on the parentheses given to us by the gods!!</h2>

<p>
Some Lisp developers act as if Lisp notation descended from the gods,
and thus is impossible to improve.
The authors do not agree, and instead believe that Lisp
notation <i>can</i> be improved from the form created in the 1950s.
The following is a summary of a
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/readable/wiki/Retort/">retort</a>
to those who believe Lisp notation cannot be improved, based on the
claims in the
<a href="http://www.lispniks.com/faq/faq.html">Common Lisp FAQ</a> and
<a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Hopl2.pdf">
&#8220;The Evolution of Lisp&#8221; by Guy Steele and Richard Gabriel</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Common Lisp FAQ says that people <i>"&#8220;wonder why Lisp can&#8217;t
use a more &#8216;normal&#8217; syntax.
It&#8217;s not because Lispers have never thought of the idea - indeed,
Lisp was originally intended to have a syntax much like FORTRAN...&#8221;</i>.
But this is not a good argument.
In other words, even Lisp&#8217;s creator (John McCarthy)
understood that directly using s-expressions for Lisp programs was undesirable.
That is strong evidence that traditional s-expression notation has problems;
even Lisp&#8217;s creator thought its notation was poor.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Hopl2.pdf">
&#8220;The Evolution of Lisp&#8221; by Guy Steele and Richard Gabriel
(HOPL2 edition)</a> says that,
<i>"&#8220;The idea of introducing Algol-like syntax into Lisp keeps popping up
and has seldom failed to create enormous controversy between those who
find the universal use of S-expressions a technical advantage (and don&#8217;t
mind the admitted relative clumsiness of S-expressions for numerical
expressions) and those who are certain that algebraic syntax is more
concise, more convenient, or even more natural...&#8221;.</i>
Note that the authors, who are advocates for s-expression notation,
admit that for numerical expressions they are clumsy.
</p>

<p>
It continues,
<i>"&#8220;We conjecture that Algol-style syntax has not really caught on in the
Lisp community as a whole for two reasons. First, there are not enough
special symbols to go around. When your domain of discourse is limited
to numbers or characters, there are only so many operations of interest,
and it is not difficult to assign one special character to each and
be done with it. But Lisp has a much richer domain of discourse,
and a Lisp programmer often approaches an application as yet another
exercise in language design; the style typically involves designing new
data structures and new functions to operate on them - perhaps dozens
or hundredsâ€&#8221;and it&#8217;s just too hard to invent that many distinct
symbols (though the APL community certainly has tried). Ultimately
one must always fall back on a general function-call notation; it&#8217;s
just that Lisp programmers don&#8217;t wait until they fail.&#8221;</i>
But this is a failing argument.
Practially all languages allow compound symbols made from multiple
characters, such as &gt;=; there is no shortage of symbols.
Also, nearly all programming languages have a function-call notation, but
only Lisp-based languages choose s-expressions to notate it, so
saying &#8220;we need function call notation&#8221; do not excuse s-expressions.
You do not need legions of special syntactic constructs;
sweet-expressions allow developers to express anything that can be
expressed with s-expressions, without being tied to a particular
semantic or requiring a massive set of special symbols.
</p>


<p>
Then it sayd,
<i>
&#8220;Second, and
perhaps more important, Algol-style syntax makes programs look less
like the data structures used to represent them. In a culture where the
ability to manipulate representations of programs is a central paradigm,
a notation that distances the appearance of a program from the appearance
of its representation as data is not likely to be warmly received (and
this was, and is, one of the principal objections to the inclusion
of loop in Common Lisp).&#8221;
</i>
Here Steele and Gabriel are <b>extremely</b> insightful.
Today we would say that s-expressions are &#8220;homoiconic&#8221;,
and that is a rare trait among programming notations.
This property is one reason
why Lisps are still used, decades after their development.
</p>
<p>
Steele and Gabriel are absolutely right; there have been many efforts
to create readable Lisp formats, and they all failed because they
did not create formats that accurately represented the programs as
data structures.  The whole point of a Lisp-like language is that
you can treat code as data, and data as code. Any notation that makes
this difficult means that you lose some of Lisp&#8217;s unique advantages.
Homoiconicity is critical if you&#8217;re going to treat a program as data. To
do so, you must be able to easily &#8220;see&#8221; the program&#8217;s format. If you can,
you can do amazing manipulations.
</p>
<p>
But what Gabriel and Steele failed to appreciate in their paper is that
it&#8217;s possible to have both.
Now that we understand why past efforts failed, we can devise notations
that keep these key properties (generality and homoiconicity) - and succeed!
</p>

<p>
Many people have noted that there are tools to help deal with s-expressions,
but this misses the point.
If the notation is so bad that you need tools to deal with it,
it would be better to fix the notation.
The resulting notation could be easier to read, and you could focus your
tools on solving problems that were not self-inflicted.
In particular, &#8220;stopping to see the parentheses&#8221; is a sign of a
serious problem - the placement of parentheses fundamentally affects
interpretation, and serious bugs can hide there.
</p>
<p>
Others who have used Lisp for years,
such as <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arcll1.html">Paul Graham</a>,
see s-expressions as long-winded, and advocate for the use of
&#8220;abbreviations&#8221; that can map down to an underlying s-expression notation.
Sweet-expressions take this approach.
</p>

<h2>Why are sweet-expressions separate from curly-infix and neoteric-expressions?</h2>
<p>
Some Scheme users and implementors may not want indentation-sensitive
syntax, or may not want to accept any change that could change the
interpretation of a legal (though poorly-formatted) s-expression.
For those users and implementors, SRFI-105 adds
infix support and neoteric-expressions such as <tt>f(x)</tt>.
SRFI-105 makes it easier to describe the &#8220;leaves&#8221; of an
s-expression tree.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, sweet-expressions make it easier to describe the larger
structure of an s-expression, by using indentation (which is usually
present anyway) as syntactically relevant.
However, sweet-expressions can change the interpretation of some
poorly-formatted s-expressions.
We believe that users of sweet-expressions will want the ability to use
SRFI-105 capabilities as well, but do not require implementation the other way.
</p>
<p>
By making sweet-expressions a separate tier,
people can adopt curly-infix if they don&#8217;t
want meaningful indentation.

<h2>Why should indentation be syntactically relevant?</h2>

<p>
Making indentation synactically meaningful eliminates many
parentheses, thus making them more readable, by making indentation
itself meaningful.  Real Lisp programs are already indented,
and tools (like editors and pretty-printers) are used to try to
keep the indentation (used by humans) and parentheses (used by
the computers) in sync.  By making the indentation (which humans
depend on) actually used by the computer, they are automatically
kept in sync, and many parentheses become unnecessary.</p>

<p>The
page <a href="http://www.gregslepak.com/on-lisps-readability"
rel="nofollow">http://www.gregslepak.com/on-lisps-readability</a> shows
one of the many examples of endless closing parentheses and brackets to
close an expression, and the confusion that happens when indentation does
not match the parentheses. bhurt&#8217;s response to that article is telling:
&#8220;I&#8217;m always somewhat amazed by the claim that the parens &#8216;just
disappear&#8217;, as if this is a good thing. Bugs live in the
difference between the code in your head and the code on the
screen - and having the parens in the wrong place causes bugs. And
autoindenting isn&#8217;t the answer- I don&#8217;t want the indenting to follow
the parens, I want the parens to follow the indenting. The indenting
I can see, and can see is correct.&#8221;</p>

<p>An IDE can help keep the
indentation consistent with the parentheses, but <a class="alink notfound"

needing IDEs is considered by some a language smell.  If you need special
tools to work around problems with the notation, then the notation itself
is a problem.</p> <p>A solution, of course, is to make the indentation
actually matter: Now you don&#8217;t need an endless march of parentheses, and
indentation can&#8217;t be confusing because it is actually used.</p> <p>"&#8220;In

to have mandatory indentation:</p>

<p>Other languages,
including Python, Haskell, Occam, and Icon, use indentation to indicate
structure, so this is a proven idea.  Other recently-developed languages
like <a href="http://cobralang.com/docs/python/" rel="nofollow">Cobra</a>
(a variant of Python with strong compile-time typechecking) have
decided to use indentation too, so clearly indentation-sensitive
languages are considered useful by many.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of
past work on indentation to represent s-expressions, too.  Examples
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul Graham (developer of Arc) is known to
be an advocate of indentation for this purpose.  As I noted above, <a

rel="nofollow">Kragen Sitaker&#8217;s notes on Graham and Arc</a>
discusses how indentation can really help (in this notation,
functions with no parameters need to be surrounded by parentheses, to
distinguish them from atoms - &#8220;oh well&#8221; ).  Graham&#8217;s <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTML" rel="nofollow">RTML</a> is
implemented using Lisp, but uses indentation instead of parentheses to
define structure.  RTML is a proprietary programming language that at

discusses a way to get S-expressions with indentation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is the relationship with SRFI-49 (I-expressions)?</h2>

<p>The sweet-expression indentation system is based on <a class=""
href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/srfi-49.html" rel="nofollow">Scheme
SRFI-49 (&#8220;surfi-49&#8221;), aka I-expressions</a>.  The basic rules of SRFI-49
(I-expression) indentation are kept in sweet-expressions; these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An indented line is a parameter of its parent.</li>
<li>Later
terms on a line are parameters of the first term.</li>
<li>A line with
exactly one term, and no child lines, is simply that term; multiple
terms are wrapped into a list.</li>
</ul>

<p>These basic rules seem quite
intuitive, and seem to be what most people &#8220;expect&#8221; indentation to mean.
We&#8217;re grateful to the SRFI-49 author for his work, and at first, we just
used SRFI-49 directly.  However, SRFI-49 turned out to have problems in
practice, so based on that experience and experimentation we made several
changes to it.
</p>


<h2 id="blank-lines">Blank lines</h2>

<p>In sweet-expressions, a blank line
always terminates a datum, so once you&#8217;ve entered a complete expression,
&#8220;Enter Enter&#8221; will always end it.
In contrast, in sweet-expressions blank
lines <em>before</em> an expression starts are ignored.
The &#8220;blank
lines at the beginning are ignored&#8221; rule eliminates a usability problem
with the original SRFI-49 (I-expression) spec, in which two sequential
blank lines before an expression surprisingly returned ().
This was a serious usability problem, and one that was quickly fixed.
The sample
implementation <em>did</em> end expressions on a blank line - the problem
was that the spec didn&#8217;t clearly capture this.</p>

<p>It would be possible
to have blank lines end an expression &#8220;only in interactive use&#8221; - Python
does this.  However, this means that you couldn&#8217;t cut-and-paste files into
the interpreter and them used.  David A. Wheeler
believes it&#8217;s important to have exactly
the same syntax in both cases, so &#8220;Enter Enter&#8221; <em>always</em> ends an
expression.</p>

<p>Of course, people sometimes want to have something like
a blank line in the middle of an s-expression.  Thus, comment-only lines
are ignored and not considered blank lines; that means you can use them
for that purpose.  The indentation of comment-only lines is ignored - that
way, you don&#8217;t have to worry about keeping them indented the same way.</p>

<p>Since a line with only indentation may look exactly identical to a
blank line, we decided to clearly state that &#8220;a line with only indentation
is an empty line&#8221;.  This eliminates some nasty usability problems that
could arise if a &#8220;blank&#8221; line actually had some whitespace in it.</p>


<h2 id="indentation-characters">Indentation characters (! as indent)</h2>
<p>Some
like to use spaces to indent; others like tabs.  Python allows either,
and SRFI-49 allows either as well - you just have to be consistent.
Thus, sweet-expressions are defined so that people can use what they like.
The only rule is that they must be consistent.</p>

<p>One problem horizontal
whitespace characters is that they can get lost in many transports
(HTML readers, etc.).  And sometimes there are indented groups that you&#8217;d
like to highlight.  On the mailing list, users started to use characters
(initially period+space) to show where indentation occurred so that they
wouldn&#8217;t get lost.  Eventually, the idea was hit upon that perhaps we
needed to allow a <em>non-whitespace</em> character for indentation.
This is highly unorthodox, but at a stroke it eliminates the complaints
some have about syntactically-important indentation, and it provides an
easy way to highlight certain indented groups.</p>

<p>At first, we tried
to use period, or period+space, as the indent.  But period has too many
other traditional meanings in Lisp-like languages, including beginning
a number (.9), beginning a symbol (.xyz), and as a special operator to
set the cdr of a list.  Implementations needed an unread-char function,
which is not stnadard in Scheme R5RS.  Eventually the &#8220;!&#8221; was used; it
practically never begins a line, and if you need it, {!} will work.
This character is also a great way to highlight indented groups.</p>

<h2 id="disabling-indentation-processing-with-paired-characters">Disabling
indentation processing with paired characters</h2>

<p>Indentation
processing is disabled inside (...), [ ... ], and { ... }.
This was also true
of SRFI-49, and of Python, and has wonderful side-effects:</p> <ul>
<li>Indent parsing becomes very safe to use with existing code.
Pre-existing code will almost certainly start each expression with
an opening parenthesis, disabling the indentation processing it
wasn&#8217;t expecting.</li>
<li>It makes it easy to disable indentation
processing whenever it is inconvenient.  For example, it supports
dealing with text that is very close to running off the right-hand
side, or is complex to express with indentation.</li>
<li>It is similar to what other indentation-sensitive languages do, such
as Python.</li>
<li>It is a very easy rule to explain.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that infix processing by curly-infix disables indentation
processing; in practice this doesn&#8217;t seem to be a problem.</p>

<h2 id="disabling-indentation-processing-with-an-initial-indent">Disabling
indentation processing with an initial indent</h2>

<p>Initial indentation also disables indentation processing,
which also improves backward
compatibility and makes it easy to disable indentation processing where
convenient.</p>

<p>This improves backward compatibility because a program
that uses odd formatting with a different meaning for sweet-expressions
is more likely to have initial indents.
Even if this is not
true, it&#8217;s trivially easy to add an initial indent on oddly-formatted
old files. This provides a trivial escape, making it easy to support
old files.  Then even if you have ancient code with odd formatting,
it would be likely to still &#8220;just work&#8221;
if there is any initial indentation.
We&#8217;d like this reader to be a drop-in replacement for read(), so minimizing
incompatibilities is important.</p>

<p>There is a risk that this
indentation will be accidental (e.g., a user might enter a blank line in
the middle of a routine and then start the next line indented).  However,
this is less likely to happen interactively (users can typically see
something happened immediately), and editors can easily detect and show
where surprising indentation is occurring (e.g., through highlighting),
so this risk appears to be minimal.</p>

<p>Disabling on initial indent
also deals with a subtle potential problem in implementation.
In a reader implementation, if we tried to just accept some indentation
of the first line and use it as the starting point, we create problems.
Typically readers return a whole value once that value has been
determined, and in many cases it&#8217;s tricky to store state (such as that
new indentation value) for an arbitrary port.  By disabling indentation
processing, we eliminate the need to store such state, as well as giving
users a useful tool.</p>

<p>Since this latter point isn&#8217;t obvious, here&#8217;s
a little more detailed explanation.  Obviously, to make indentation
syntactically meaningful, you need to know where an expression indents,
and where it ends. If you read in a line, and it has the same indentation
level, that should end the previous expression. If its indentation is
<em>less</em>, it should close out all the lines with deeper or equal
indentation.  But we&#8217;re trying to <em>minimize</em> the changes to the
underlying language, and in particular, we don&#8217;t want to change the &#8220;read&#8221;
interface and we&#8217;re not assuming arbitrary amounts of unread-char.
Scheme R5RS, for example, doesn&#8217;t have a standard unread-char
at all.  So let&#8217;s say you are trying to read the following:</p>
<pre>
! ! foo
! ! ! bar
! ! eggs
! ! cheese
</pre>
<p>You might expect this to
return three datums: (foo bar), eggs, and cheese. It won&#8217;t, in a typical
implementation; here&#8217;s why:
<ul>
<li>
In the first read(), it reads foo, bar, and it
consumes the indentation of &#8220;eggs&#8221; so that it can determine that another
is at the same level. It returns (foo bar).</li>
<li>In the second read(), it reads
eggs with NO indentation, because the indentation was consumed by the
first read() so it could determine when it was finished. It then reads
the indentation of cheese, which has an indentation more than zero. It
returns (eggs cheese), and we&#8217;ve consumed it all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have unlimited unread-char, there is no problem, just
unconsume characters once you&#8217;ve found the end. But many Lisps don&#8217;t have
that.</li>
<li>Read could store indentation state associated with the
port. But the user could call other routines, and a naive implementation
would read the wrong values. You&#8217;d have to re-wrap the entire I/O system
if you really wanted to be able to undo the indentation reliably. That
creates a complicated implementation that is likely to be unreliable,
and it&#8217;s lousy for performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>So for all the reasons
above, initial indent disables indentation processing for that line.</p>

<h2 id="grouping-and-splicing">Grouping and splicing (\\)</h2>
<p>SFRI-49
had a mechanism for defining lists of lists, using the symbol &#8220;group&#8221;.
This was a valuable contribution, since there needs to be <em>some</em>
way to show lists of lists.  But after use, it was determined that having
an alphabetic symbol being used to indicate a special abbreviation was
a mistake; all other abbreviations use punctuation, and this should too.
This symbol is called the GROUP symbol, and happens at the start of a line
(after indentation).</p>
<p>A different problem is that sometimes you&#8217;d
like to have a set of parameters, where they are at the &#8220;same level&#8221; but
writing them as indented parameters takes up too much vertical space.
An obvious example is keywords in various Lisps; having to write this
is painful:
</p>
<pre>
foo
  keyword1:
  parameter1
  keyword2:
  parameter2
  ....
</pre>
<p>
David A. Wheeler created an early splicing proposal. After much discussion, to solve the latter problem, the SPLIT symbol was created, so that you could do:
</p>
<pre>
foo
  keyword1: \\ parameter1
  keyword2: \\ parameter2
  ....
</pre>

<p>At first the symbol \ was used for SPLIT, but this
would cause serious problem on Lisps that supported slashification.
After long discussion, the symbol \\ was decided on for both; although
the number of characters in the underlying symbol could vary (depending on
whether or not slashification was used), this was irrelevant and seemed to
work everywhere.  By using the same symbol for both GTROUP and SPLIT, we
reduced the number of different symbols that users needed to escape.</p>

<p>We dropped the SRFI-49 method for escaping the symbol by repeating
it (group group); the {} escape mechanism is more regular, and
makes it far more obvious that some special escape is going on.</p>

<h2
id="why-does-initial-group-mean-nothing-if-there-are-datums-afterwards-on-the-same-line">Why
does initial \\ mean nothing if there are datums afterwards
on the same line?</h2>
<p>Since &#8220;let&#8221; occurs in many programs,
it would have been possible to define \\ to allow this:</p>
<pre>
let
! \\ var1 $ bar x
! !  var2 $ quux x
! nitz var1 var2
</pre>
<p>
We discussed this, but after long discussion we decided on a defined semantic that means that &#8220;\\&#8221; is an empty symbol, making that expression exactly the same as:
</p>
<pre>
let
! var1 $ bar x
! !  var2 $ quux x
! nitz var1 var2
</pre>

<p>We did this
intentionally.  It turns out that there are situations where you want a \\
as an empty symbol, even when text follows it on the line.  An example is
arc&#8217;s if-then-else, where there are <em>logically</em> pairs of items,
but from a <em>list</em> semantic are at the same level. E.G.:</p>
</pre>
if
! condition1()
! \\ action1()
! condition2()
! \\ action2()
! \\ otherwise-action()
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to handle let* with an extra line, but there&#8217;s
no easy way to insert a short pseudo-comment character in the front unless
we do it this way.</p>
<p>The multi-line nature of let* turns out to be
not a real problem, for 2 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It turns out that in many
&#8220;let*s&#8221; the variable settings can be put on one line. As of 2012-08-02 the
&#8220;sweeten.sscm&#8221; has 305 non-blank, non-comment lines
(as determined by <tt>grep -v '^$' sweeten.sscm | grep -v '^ *;' | wc -l</tt>).
Of those, 13 lines use let or let*, and only one of those &#8220;lets&#8221; uses \\.
It&#8217;s not worth optimizing a case that only happens approximately once in
300 lines.</li>
<li>
Using the abbreviations as intended is REALLY
clear, even though it uses an extra vertical line.
</li>
</ol>
<p>So the savings for <em>let</em> aren&#8217;t significant, the
semantics as designed are clear, and are intentionally using that
notation for another purpose where it&#8217;s not as easy to use an
alternative.</p>

<h2 id="traditional-notation-abbreviations">Traditional
notation abbreviations</h2>
<p>As with SRFI-49, a leading traditional
abbreviation (quote, comma, backquote, or comma-at), followed by space
or tab, is that operator applied to the sweet-expression starting at the
same line.  This makes it easy to quote (or whatever) complex indented
structures.</p>

<h2 id="sublist">Sublist ($)</h2>

<p>Alan Manuel Gloria
noted that certain constructs were common and annoying to express,
e.g., first(second(third(fourth))), and based on Haskell experience,
suggested being able to write them as first $ second $ third(fourth).
Again, the idea is that this is an abbreviation for a common-enough
practice.</p>

<p>This is another example (like GROUP/SPLIT) of a
construct that, when you need it, is incredibly useful.
It&#8217;s not
all that unusual to have a few processing or cleanup functions that
take a single argument, and for all the &#8220;real work&#8221; to be nested
in something else.
This would require several levels of indentation
without sublist, but they are easily handled with sublist.
</p>
<p>
An example is
scsh, which has functions like &#8220;run&#8221; that another list.  With sublist,
this is easily expressed.  For example, here&#8217;s a sweet-expression using
scsh:
<pre>
  run $ grep -i "xx.*zz" &lt;(oldfile) &gt;(newfile)
</pre>


<p>After discussion, sublist was accepted in July 2012.</p>

<h2>Markers &lt;* and *&gt;</h2>
<p>
The markers &lt;* and *&gt; are reserved for future use.
These may, at some point, have the following syntax
as described in an
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/readable-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00806.html">email posted 2012-09-02</a>:

<blockquote>
<i>
&lt;* ... *&gt; are like ( ... ) in that they surround a list,
but they do NOT turn 
off indentation processing.
A &#8220;&lt;*&#8221; resets the &#8220;indent&#8221; level to a 0-length 
string, skips all horizontal whitespace, and then restarts reading an 
expression with indentation processing still live.
A blank line inside &lt;* ... 
*&gt; ends an expression WITHIN the &lt;* ... *&gt;,
but stays within &lt;* ... *&gt;; only 
eof or active *&gt; can close the &lt;*.
Once all that mapping is done, the range of 
&lt;* ... *&gt; is replaced with the mapped result.
</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, the symbols <tt>&lt;*</tt> and <tt>*&gt;</tt>
must be escaped (e.g., using {...}) if they are used in an
indentation-processing context.


<h2 id="alternative-q2">Comparison to Q2</h2>
<p>An interesting
experimental notation, &#8220;Q2&#8221;, was developed by Per Bothner; see
<a href="http://per.bothner.com/blog/2010/Q2-extensible-syntax/"
rel="nofollow">http://per.bothner.com/blog/2010/Q2-extensible-syntax/</a>.
</p>
<p>Q2 has somewhat similar goals to the &#8220;readable&#8221; project, though
with a different approach. The big difference is that David A. Wheeler
decided it was important to have a generic notation for <em>any</em>
s-expression. Here is a brief additional comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sweet-expressions have infix, though not built-in precedence
(precedence can be implemented by defining <tt>$nfx$</tt>).
</li>
<li>Both have &#8220;juxtaposition for function application&#8221;</li>
<li>Q2 has
&#8220;Naming a zero-argument function applies it&#8221; but this is awkward, indeed,
&#8220;The exact rule for a distinguishing between a variable reference
and a zero-argument function application isn&#8217;t decided yet.&#8221; In
sweet-expressions, a zero-argument function name is called by adding
() after it or around it, e.g., pi().</li>
<li>"&#8220;Flexible token format&#8221;
- both require operators to be delimited.</li>
<li>"&#8220;Use indentation
for grouping&#8221; - both use indentation for grouping</li>
<li>"&#8220;Block
expressions yield multiple values&#8221; - In sweet-expressions, you use
usual Scheme procedures, including value, instead of having special
syntax.</li>
<li>REPL: In sweet-expressions, you usually end a line
with ENTER ENTER. Q2 doesn&#8217;t, but Wheeler worries that you have to be careful
or it&#8217;ll end where it syntactically might not need to.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing-out-results">Writing out results</h2>
<p>An obvious question
is, &#8220;how do you write them out?&#8221;  After all, with these notations there is
more than one way to present expressions.</p>

<p>But no Lisp guarantees
that what it writes out is the same sequence of characters that was
written.  For example, <tt>(quote&nbsp;x)</tt>
when read might be written back
as <tt>'x</tt>, while on others, reading
<tt>'y</tt> might be printed as <tt>(quote&nbsp;y)</tt>.
Similarly, if you enter <tt>(a&nbsp;.&nbsp;(b&nbsp;.&nbsp;()))</tt>,
many Lisps will write that back as &#8220;(a&nbsp;b)&#8221;.
Nothing has fundamentally changed;
as always, you should implement your Lisp expression writer so that
it presents a format convenient to both human and machine readers.</p>

<h2 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h1>
<p>Backwards compatibility with traditional Lisp notation is helpful.
These notations are fully compatible with <em>well-formatted</em> Lisp
s-expressions.
</p>
<p>
Neoteric-expressions
are compatible for what I&#8217;d call &#8220;normal&#8221; formatting.  The key issue is
that it changes the meaning of an opening paren after a character other
than whitespace or another opening paren.  So if you&#8217;re using to saving
whitespace that will be different.  Basically, a(b) becomes
the single expressions &#8220;(a&nbsp;b)&#8221;,
not the two expressions &#8220;a&#8221; followed later by &#8220;(b)&#8221;.
There are millions of lines of Lisp code that would never
see the difference.  So if you wrote &#8220;a(b)&#8221; expecting it to be &#8220;a&nbsp;(b)&#8221;,
you will need to insert the space.
</p>
<p>
Sweet-expressions add
indentation processing, but since indentation is disabled inside (...),
and initial indentation also disables indentation processing,
ordinary Lisp expressions immediately disable indentation processing and
typically don&#8217;t cause issues.
In rare cicumstances they can be intepreted differently:

<ul>
<li>If you have a <em>top-level</em> expression
when more than one datum on a line <em>and</em> the line doesn&#8217;t begin
with space/tab.  Thus, at the topmost level, &#8220;(a) (b)&#8221; on one line
is interpreted as two datums &#8220;(a)&#8221; followed by &#8220;(b)&#8221; in traditional
Lisp, but this is a single &#8220;((a) (b))&#8221; in sweet-expressions.</li>
<li>Sweet-expressions also count &#8220;!&#8221; at the beginning of a line as
an indent character.  This rarely causes any issue, since once you
use an open parenthesis to start an expression, this meaning for
&#8220;!&#8221; is disabled.  Generally, you&#8217;d have to have a symbol whose name
<em>starts</em> with &#8220;!&#8221; before any issue could come up.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In any case, you
can disable sweet-expression processing with a space indent, so just
inserting a space on every line <em>ensures</em> compatibility with the
sweet-expression indentation processing.</p>


<h2>Past experiences</h2>
<p>
At least two programs have been written using sweet-expressions:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net"><i>sweeten</i></a>
by David A. Wheeler is
a program that reads traditionally-formatted
s-expressions and writes sweet-expressions.
This program performs a great deal of traditional list processing, and
is part of the &#8220;readable&#8221; project&#8217;s git repository.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AmkG/letterfall"><i>letterfall</i></a>
by Alan Manuel K. Gloria is a graphical
real-time touch typing game to improve typing skills, which uses
GNOME libraries.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The SRFI authors believe that the existence of these programs -
written by two different people for different application areas -
shows that sweet-expressions are mature enough to be standardized.

<h1><a name="reference-implementation">Reference implementation</a></h1>
<p>
??? TODO
</p>

<p>The implementation below is portable, with the exception that
Scheme provides no standard mechanism to override the built-in reader.
An implementation that complies with this SRFI must
at least activate this behavior
when they read the <code>#!sweet</code> marker
followed by whitespace.
</p>
<p>This reference implementation is SRFI type 2: &#8220;A
mostly-portable solution that uses some kind of hooks provided in
some Scheme interpreter/compiler. In this case, a detailed
specification of the hooks must be included so that the SRFI is
self-contained.&#8221;</p>
<p>For clarity, this is split into two parts:
(1) code that implements the SRFI, and (2) a demo (with support procedures)
to show its use.
This SRFI is trivial to implement, so most of the code is actually in
part 2.

Notes on HTML 3.2:
* HTML 3.2 has no attribute "id", so we use <a name="ID">...</a> instead.
* HTML 3.2 doesn't include CSS "style", so a table is is used to format
  the curly-infix list BNF.
* HTML 3.2 lacks many named entities, so we use numbered entities.
  Although HTML 3.2 includes a mechanism to define new entities inline
  (as part of the DOCTYPE), this is not supported by more modern
  systems (e.g., Firefox).  In contrast, *EVERYONE* supports HTML
  numbered entities.
* The character ' is fine in HTML and XML, but the "quoter" tool
  (that automatically convert single and double quotes into curly quotes)
  will convert them.  That's fine for constructs like "doesn't", but
  is wrong when referring to Scheme's "quote" abbreviation.
  A useful solution is to represent it as an HTML entity.
  The named entity &apos; is in XML 1.0 and HTML 4.0, but not in HTML 3.2,
  so we cannot use "&apos;" to represent it.  Instead, this file
  uses &#39; for single vertical apostrophe.  That way, it will
  not be converted later to curly quotes by "quoter" and similar tools.
* HTML 3.2 doesn't allow <style...> in the head; but this is
  commonly-implemented, and implementations that don't will just
  back off to a less-pretty format.
* HTML 3.2 doesn't allow <div> to declare a class, but this is
  widely implemented, and helpful for the CSS.  Systems that
  don't implement it can trivially back off of it.
