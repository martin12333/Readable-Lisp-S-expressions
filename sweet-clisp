# By David A. Wheeler. Start up clisp in "sweet-expression" reading mode,
# so you can try it out.  Setting *print-escape* isn't ideal, but
# in most circumstances it works out.

# NOTE: For now, this assumes that the current directory has the
# readable library *.lisp and *.asd files, and that tests/my-asdf.lisp
# has a valid asdf implementation.  That way, we can ensure that we
# run the current developmental version, not what's installed (if anything).
