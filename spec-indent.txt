I-expressions: Detailed Specification

2008-01-05

SRFI-49 (http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/srfi-49.html dated 2005/05/29)
provides a pretty good system for indentation, but there are some issues
with it.  The spec has a few errors, and the BNF productions don't
include much information on the whitespace-handling (which may explain
why the sample implementation has bugs in handling comments in certain
constructs).  Instead, much of the whitespace handling is described
only informally.  In addition, the sample code isn't obviously related
to the BNF productions, so it's difficult to be confident that the code
is correct even if that bug was fixed.

So, below are step-by-step transforms of the
SRFI-49 rules.  The first one is a mild "fix-up" of the SFRI rules;
the second takes the first and adds whitespace rules that are
(mostly) implicit in the text, as well as proposing a way to deal
with "initial indent".

It may be easier to simply re-implement the spec, given the details,
so that we can be more confident that the final code is correct.

===========================================================
The SRFI-49 spec productions are modified as follows:

(1) Fix spec bug: the "head" productions' "expr" are changed to "s-expr"

(2) Fix spec bug: the rule for "head-> s-expr" is changed from "(list expr)"
    to "(list $1)"

(3) Fix spec bug: the missing rule for UNQUOTE-SPLICING has been added

(4) Editorial: rules are reordered so the GROUP productions are adjacent

(5) Relaxation of rule: This version adds a "start-expr" production,
    which defines reading the first line of an expression, and adds a new
    rule to permit indented initial lines:
        start-expr -> INDENT expr DEDENT

    Rationale: The original specification completely forbid initial
    indentation, but this turns out to have been overly strict.  See below
    for details about various alternatives. This alternative was selected
    because it has the "obvious" meaning, yet does NOT require "read"
    to store hidden indentation state after returning.  Many other
    alternatives required hidden state or could be easily misleading
    (resulting in subtle bugs).  This means that if initial expressions
    are all indented, they must be separated with blank lines.

(6) Proposed bug-fix: After the FIRST line of an expression, any
    line with ONLY spaces and tabs (and no comments)
    is considered the same as one with no horizontal whitespace;
    in either case, they end the expression.

    This is only a small change from the spec text as literally written.
    A line with zero or more horizontal whitespace characters followed by
    a ;-comment, aka an "empty line", is (still) ALWAYS ignored
    and not considered for indentation processing. In addition,
    a line with ONLY horizontal whitespace characters, aka a
    "blank line" (it has only blanks), is (still) ignored and skipped
    when reading the first line of an expression, and is not considered
    for indentation processing.

    Rationale: If the spec were followed literally,
    interactivity would be quite unpleasant; the results of an
    expression would NEVER be written until after the next
    expression's first line was entered.
    In addition, printed and displayed text could not be understood with
    certainty - a line that looked completely blank COULD mean either
    "expression completed" OR "expression continues", depending on the
    invisible whitespace indentation - leading to hard-to-debug code.

    This bug-fix makes it clear that entering a blank (whitespace-only)
    line at the end of an expression will cause
    it to be executed.  I-expressions were specifically designed
    so that they will work the same way whether they are entered
    interactively or via a file, enabling cut-and-paste
    and avoiding the complexities of a "mode" flag.
    Note that the sample _implementation_ did not actually follow the
    spec as worded either; this is considered a bug in the spec.

    To create vertical space, just use a ;-leading comment.  Note that
    lines with only leading whitespace and ;-comments MAY, but
    NEED NOT, align with other text - so quick "FIXME" comments, or
    lengthy comments, need not be forced to match the indentation.

    Note that multiline comments (e.g., #| ... |#) are NOT considered
    comments by these rules; there is simply no way a
    single-character-lookahead library implementation can reliably detect
    such multicharacter sequences without disabling the reader's
    implementation of # prefixes.

    *** THIS IS UNDER DISCUSSION IN THE MAILING LIST. ***
    Rationale: This means that people do not need to "line up" indentation
    of comments.  This ability is useful for "FIXME" comments, or for
    long comments to explain a complicated circumstance which is deeply
    indented.  Since this ONLY applies to ;-comment-only lines,
    blank lines (without comments) still end an expression - so
    interactive use is still pleasant.  Most importantly, there's no
    need for a difference between interactive and non-interactive use -
    there's no need for a "mode" flag (which can be hard to get right),
    and you can always cut-and-paste from a file into an interactive session.

    TODO: If this proposal is acceptable (or another one found that's even
    better), reword the clarifications to merge this in, and modify the
    "more detailed spec" below to match.

(7) Proposed Clarification: the term "group" ONLY has the
    special meaning below if it begins with "G" or "g".  An I-expression
    parser MUST NOT interpret it as an I-expression group otherwise.

    Rationale: This permits using the underlying implementation's
    symbol escape mechanisms to express solely the symbol group
    WITHOUT giving it the special I-expression meaning.  The spec was
    not clear what an I-expression reader should do with escaped
    symbols that _mean_ group, but do not start with G or g.

    TODO: If this proposal is acceptable (or another one found that's even
    better), reword the clarifications to merge this in, and modify the
    "more detailed spec" below to match.

===========================================================
Updated SRFI-49 spec productions

The modified production rules are:

  start-expr -> expr
    $1
  start-expr -> INDENT expr DEDENT
    $2 ; Use "most consistent" approach for handling toplevel indents.

  ; Abbreviations; these are considered first, BEFORE reading as s-expr:
  expr -> QUOTE expr
   (list 'quote $2)
  expr -> QUASIQUOTE expr
   (list 'quasiquote $2)
  expr -> UNQUOTE expr
   (list 'unquote $2)
  expr -> UNQUOTE-SPLICING expr  ; ,@
   (list 'unquote-splicing $2)

  ; Note: GROUP is defined so it's only meaningful if it's the first
  ; non-abbreviation of the line; GROUP has no special effect elsewhere.
  expr -> GROUP head INDENT body DEDENT
   (append $2 $4)
  expr -> GROUP INDENT body DEDENT
   $3
  expr -> GROUP head
   (if (= (length $2) 1)
       (car $2)
     $2)
  expr -> head INDENT body DEDENT
   (append $1 $3)
  expr -> head
   (if (= (length $1) 1)
       (car $1)
     $1)

  ; "head" is what happens on ONE line, and a head sequence ends with eol.
  head-> s-expr head
   (append $1 $2)
  head-> s-expr
   (list $1)

  ; "body" is the set of children lines (from the point-of-view of head)
  body -> expr body
    (cons $1 $2)
  body ->
   '()


===========================================================
Detailed version of spec

The original spec described primarily in words what to do about whitespace.
This can make it difficult to implement with certainty, so the following
is a more detailed version of the production rules, but with whitespace
rules made explicit as part of the productions (instead of being
implicit in the English text).  We do this by modifying the
whitespace preprocessor's description slightly; it will output
SPACE or TAB if not at beginning of line, and at the end of each line
it will report NL (newline) or EOF (end of file).  It will NOT consume
comments (beginning with ";" through EOL).  It will still notice
the beginning of a line (start of reading, or after NL),
and conceptually output INDENT or DEDENT as appropriate after NL
(if it outputs neither after NL, we're on the SAME indentation level).
EOF can start a whole new expression, but can't be in the middle of one
(so  ' <EOF> is not legal).

Proposal: Treat as line with only horizontal whitespace as if it's
a line solely with newline - i.e., as if the horizontal whitespace
didn't even exist.  After all, you can't see the difference when printing,
and typically can't see them when editing either.
This appears to be the safer alternative.

TODO: The text below is excessively complex, so the risk
of mis-implementation is high.  Switch to a description where
SAME is also returned, and describe the indentation processing
in a more procedural way.

get-leading-hspace:
   sequence <- get sequence of spaces and tabs
   if memv(peek() '(NL EOF))
      ""  ; if whitespace followed by newline (no ;), treat as newline-by-self
      sequence

Here's the state machine of the whitespace processor, described
in pseudocode using sweet-expressions 0.2:

Start:
  {newstate <- Leftedge}
  push("")
Left-edge:
  {new-indent <- get-leading-hspace()}
  {newstate <- process-edge}
Process-edge:
  cond
    {new-indent > peek()}  {newstate <- Normal} push(new-indent) return(INDENT)
    {new-indent = peek()}  {newstate <- Normal}
    {new-indent < peek()}  {newstate <- Process-edge} pop() return(DEDENT)
    else error("Incomparable indents")
Normal:
  {c <- get-char()}
  if memv(c '(NL EOF))
    {newstate <- Left-edge}
  return(c)


The state machine need not be IMPLEMENTED this way.
Characters can be peeked, then used there if they aren't NL/EOF;
if they are NL/EOF then call to find the new line's indent.
Pass down to routines the string with "current line's indent", and return
(current-line-indent result)... procedure returns can be the
equivalent of DEDENT processing, and procedure calls the equivalent
of INDENT processing.  But it's easier to DESCRIBE this way.



  ; Definitions of whitespace:
  eol -> comment? eol-final               ; eol = "end of line"
  comment -> ";" (not NL|EOF)*   ; Note: does not consume NL or EOF.
  eol-final -> NL | EOF
  hspace -> SPACE | TAB


  ; Start-up is slightly special (esp. EOF).
  start-expr -> EOF  ; Consume this EOF, in case it's interactive.
    $1 ; EOF can only occur at top level, so ' <EOF> is not legal.
  start-expr -> (SPACE | TAB)* (";" (not NL EOF))? (NL | EOF) start-expr
    $last ; skip any initial content-free lines.
  start-expr -> INDENT expr DEDENT
    $2 ; Use "most consistent" approach for handling toplevel indents.
  start-expr -> expr
    $1


  ; Abbreviations; these are considered first, BEFORE reading as s-expr:
  expr -> QUOTE hspace* expr
   (list 'quote $2)
  expr -> QUASIQUOTE hspace* expr
   (list 'quasiquote $2)
  expr -> UNQUOTE hspace* expr
   (list 'unquote $2)
  expr -> UNQUOTE-SPLICING hspace* expr  ; ,@
   (list 'unquote-splicing $2)
  ; Note: Abbreviations only accept expr at tail, not eol? INDENT body DEDENT.
  ; Therefore, you can't have an abbreviation symbol followed by a newline,
  ; you MUST follow it with an expression.

  ; In actual code, you can't tell between GROUP and head until an
  ; s-expr is read in.  So in the implementation, read in an s-expr,
  ; then look at the s-expr to see if it's "group" or not.
  expr -> GROUP hspace* head INDENT body DEDENT
   (append $2 $4)
  expr -> GROUP hspace* INDENT body DEDENT
   $3
  expr -> GROUP hspace* head
   (if (= (length $2) 1)
       (car $2)
     $2)
  expr -> head INDENT body DEDENT
   (append $1 $3)
  expr -> head
   (if (= (length $1) 1)
       (car $1)
     $1)

  head -> s-expr hspace+ head ; hspace+ can be read with hspace*
   (append $1 $3)
  head -> s-expr hspace* eol
   (list $1)

  body -> expr body
    (cons $1 $2)
  body ->
   '()       ; No more children
  body -> comment eol-final body
   $2        ; Skip comment lines with the same indentation

  ; s-expr is a traditional s-expr, aka datum.  It does NOT begin with ";",
  ; hspace, NL, or EOF.  To implement it, the I-expression reader calls
  ; the _previous_ reader of datum.
  ; When processing "expr", the special definitions for
  ; abbreviations QUOTE etc. take precedence; but if you're processing
  ; the later entries of "head" (i.e., datums that are NOT the first
  ; datum on the line), the s-expr reader must handle the abbreviations.

  ; Note: I-expressions do not provide special syntax for improper lists,
  ; e.g., (a . b).  When you need them, just use s-expressions or cons.
  ; A _syntax_ for this would be easy, e.g., rules like:
  ;   head -> s-expr hspace+ "." hspace+ s-expr
  ; However, it'd be hard to IMPLEMENT, because "." is a leading character
  ; for many different circumstances (.9, ..., etc.), yet calling the
  ; underlying reader might not be effective.  E.G., clisp's "read" will
  ; fail if given a solo ".".  Since you can use s-expressions or cons
  ; to construct these, there doesn't seem to be a compelling need for such
  ; a special syntax in I-expressions, anyway... especially given
  ; their implementation headaches.

========================

The original final I-expression spec says:
"Unfourtunately, [in Python] the syntaxes of file input and
interactive input differs slightly...
[In I-expressions,]
Each line in a file is either empty (contains only whitepace and/or a
comment), or contains some code, preceeded by some number of space and/or tab
characters.
In the following syntax definition, this initial space, as well as linebreaks,
is not included in the rules. Instead, preceding any matching, the leading
space of each line is compared to the leading space of the last non-empty line
preceeding it, and then removed. If the line is preceeded by more space than
the last one was, the special symbol INDENT is added..."

Thus, in the original spec, a line with only horizontal whitespace,
optionally trailed by a comment (presumably a ;-comment), was ignored after
the first line of an expression.  But this says nothing about what
happens on the FIRST line of an expression.  In addition, the text implies
that in I-expressions, the file input and interactive input formats
are the same, yet this is improbable as stated.  The "obvious" reading
suggests that blank lines ("Enter Enter") at the end of an expression
are ignored, but this would mean that in interactive use, the output
of a first expression would only be produced after the first line of the
second expression were entered.  This would lead to confusion like this
(where ">" is an input prompt):
> + 1 1
> + 1 2
2
> + 1 3
3

The sample implementation given in SFRI-49 didn't really follow
the spec of SFRI-49.  For example, it DID accept indentation of the
first line (though with a problematic semantic), and it DID accept
blank lines (in some cases) as ending an expression.
This suggests that these need to be re-thought and more carefully defined
in a revision.

========================
ISSUE: Leading whitespace at start of expression reading in I-expressions

I propose a specific interpretation for leading whitespace in an
indented I-expression, which I'll call the "most consistent" format.
Below is an explanation of the problem, and my proposed resolution.

Thoughts?  After fiddling with the alternatives, I'm getting very worried that
it'd be easy to type in text that would APPEAR to mean one thing, but would
ACTUALLY mean something else.  That's definitely something to avoid.
My "most consistent" proposal completely avoids that, without being quite as
strict as Python's "thou shalt always start any expression at the left edge".

First, the initial situation:  The I-expression spec revised 2005/05/29
does NOT permit an indentation at the beginning of an expression.
The sample implementation does permit them; it simply skips horizontal
whitespace on the first line (ignoring them).  The spec's completely
forbidding them is easily done, but is overly strict; the
"skip horizontal whitespace" approach has unforunate consequences
(as discussed further below).

What SHOULD be done if the start of an expression
(I'll call that start-expr) begins with whitespace that
is followed by content (and not just an
;-comments, newline (NL) or end-of-file (EOF))? E.G.:
 start-expr -> hspace+ (not eol...)

An example should make it clear. Imagine you read this (three lines,
all indented to the same level at the TOPMOST level):
   x
   y
   z

One interpretation is that there should be 3 different results: x, y, and z.
But consider how this would be read.
You'd read in the indentation before x, and note
that as the "topmost" indentation.  Then you'd read in the indentation
before y, notice that it was the same as x's, and stop just before reading
the "y" and return with just "x".
But wait - if you did that, when you read "y" you would think that there
was <i>no</i> indentation (the previous read consumed it), and thus z
would be further indented... returning (y&nbsp;z).  Ooops, that can't be right.

Since essentially the dawn of Lisp in the 1950s
there has been a "read" function that reads an S-expression
from the input and returns it.
This is an extremely stable function interface, and one not easily changed
in fundamental ways.
In particular, no user of "read" expects it to <i>also</i> return some
state - such as the indentation that was read the <i>last</i> time read
was called - and certainly they aren't going to provide that information
back to "read" anyway.
Not only is this difficult to change for backwards-compatibility reasons,
it's not clear you should - simple interfaces are a good idea, if you can
get them, and adding such "indentation state" as a required parameter would
certainly complicate the interface.

In theory, you could "unget" all the indentation characters, so that the
next read would work correctly.
But support for this is rare; for example,
Scheme doesn't even <i>have</i> a standard unget character function, and
the Common Lisp standard only supports one character unget (not enough!).

You could store "hidden state" inside the read function.
Problem is, character-reading is not the exclusive domain of the read function;
many other functions read characters, and they are unlikely to look at this
hidden state.
These functions tend to be low-level functions and in some implementations
are difficult to override.  So you'd probably have inconsistent values
from different reading functions, a recipe for subtle bugs.
What's more, you would have to store hidden state for each possible input
source, and this can become insane in the many implementations that support
support ports of non-files (such as from strings).
"Hidden state" could allow for all this, but the complications of
<i>implementing</i> hidden state suggests that it'd be better to spec
something that does <i>not</i> require hidden state.




Possible solutions:

1. Simplest approach: Forbid it.  It's an error if it doesn't start on
left line.  Python does this.  You could argue that the original spec requires
this, since there's no production that accepts an initial INDENT.
The xyz example above would then be illegal.

But this is not very flexible; #2 (next) appears to be a better option.

2. Most consistent: Allow indentation on initial line (and consider that
the indentation for that expression), as long all later lines have
a further indentation OR are on the left edge (including a blank line
ending in EOL or EOF, or a comment the left edge).
Anything on the left edge ends the expression.
This at least LETS you indent each expression if you like,
with NO risk of misinterpretation of later lines.
The result is that you can indent the first lines of expressions.. you just
have to separate the different expressions with blank lines.
To implement this:
start-expr -> INDENT expr DEDENT

The xyz example above would be illegal, and thus rejected.
However, if you inserted blank lines between x, y, and z, you'd be okay.

This is the most consistent and most flexible, and has no risk of
misinterpretation, so I propose this one.

3. Original implementation ignores hspace:
start-expr -> hspace+ start-expr
  $2

But when this is given the xyz example above, it will misleadingly
produce (x y z).  That kind of surprise seems undesirable, esp. given
that there is alternative #2.

4. Instead, could disable indent processing on initial hspace, to maximize
backwards-compatibility and simplify some command line use:
start-expr -> hspace+ s-expr
  $2

This would read in the "xyz" example as you would expect.  It would
also read in old text like this as it was originally intended:
  (define x 5) (define y 6)

However, other formats will be misinterpreted, e.g.,
  fact
    5
will be understood as the two separate expressions (requiring two reads):
  fact
  5
and not as (fact 5).

This is risky; on printouts, it might not at ALL be obvious when
expressions are indented like this - resulting in hard-to-debug code
and hidden defects.

In general, I think it's much wiser to reject text that might
be very easily misinterpreted by the reader.  So I suggest #2.


========================
ISSUE: Blank and comment-only lines after initial line of an expression.

    *** THIS IS UNDER DISCUSSION IN THE MAILING LIST. ***

After the initial line of an expression,
any line containing only zero or more leading spaces and tabs,
FOLLOWED by a ";"-leading comment, is COMPLETELY IGNORED, even in the
middle of an expression.  In particular, its indentation is ignored.
This is consistent with the original definition of I-expressions.

The proposed change is to (1) consider lines with ONLY horizontal
whitespace - and NO semicolon-leading comment - to be the same as a line
with no characters at all, AND (2) to have blank lines end an expression.

If lines with only zero or more horizontal whitespace are completely
ignored, as the original spec stated, then interactive use is painful.
Results would print only after the first line of the NEXT expression
are entered.  Even the "sample implementation" in the spec didn't
actually do this.

To make interactivity pleasant, at least lines with absolutely no
characters should end an expression after the first line.  That way,
"Enter enter" will cause an expression to be executed.

Then the question becomes, how should a line with ONLY 1 or more
spaces/tabs (and no ;-comments) be interpreted?  They COULD be interpreted
as "continue the indentation" if they matched the indentation of the
previous line that didn't have just a comment. Problem is, this
could lead to mysterious bugs.
Printed or displayed text could not be understood with certainty; a
line that looked empty COULD mean either "expression completed" OR
"expression continues", leading to hard-to-debug code.
To create vertical space, just use a ;-leading comment.

It is true that Python 2.5 in _interactive_ mode distinguishes
between lines with no characters (not even whitespace) and lines
with only whitespace.  In interactive mode, a line with no characters
ends an expression, while lines with whitespace are considered relevant
(and can continue further lines).  However, Python 2.5 in
_file-reading_ mode has different semantics - it ignores both types of
lines (they have no effect on indentation).  This difference in modes
has the problem that it can cause cutting-and-pasting from a file to
an interactive session to fail, which is unfortunate.
But it's even more difficult for a Lisp-based system; it's often even
more difficult to be certain when a session is interactive or not -
there is no standard way for doing so.  This distinction of
interactive and non-interactive modes is very inconvenient, and
should be avoided if practical.

Note that this does NOT change how comment-only lines, preceded by
only 0+ spaces and tabs, are interpreted - these are STILL completely
ignored, and any indentation they have is considered irrelevant.
Thus, people will not need to "line up" indentation
of comments. This is useful for "FIXME" comments, or for
long comments to explain a complicated circumstance which is deeply
indented.  Since this ONLY applies to ;-comment-only lines,
blank lines (without comments) still end an expression - so
interactive use is still pleasant.  Most importantly, there's no
need for a difference between interactive and non-interactive use -
there's no need for a "mode" flag (which can be hard to get right),
and you can always cut-and-paste from a file into an interactive session.
