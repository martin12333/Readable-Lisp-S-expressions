#   sweet-clisp [clisp-options] [FILE-TO-RUN.slisp [args]]
# Start up clisp in "sweet-expression" reading mode.
# To use un-installed sweet-expr implementation, set CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY. E.G.:
#    CL_SOURCE_REGISTRY="$PWD" ./sweet-clisp ...

# A useful "clisp-option" is "-modern".
# This sets *print-escape*; this isn't ideal, but
# in most circumstances it works well, and clisp has no better way
# of disabling its unnecessary escapes which otherwise look ugly.

# Except as otherwise marked, this code is licensed under the "MIT license".
# However, the "override" code that patches clisp is derived
# from clisp, which is GPLv2.
# Thus consider the work as a whole as "MIT and GPLv2".

# If it weren't for a bug in the clisp REPL, we could just do this:
#   clisp $clisp_options -x "$setup_commands" -repl
# But if two t-expressions are not separated by a newline, then
# clisp REPL throws away the first line of the second t-expression.
# Solution: We'll override sys::read-form.
# Unfortunately, read-eval-print directly calls read-form in a way that
# cannot be overridden... so we have to override it, too.


# NOTE: The code below in "override" is derived from clisp,
# which is GPL-licensed.  This is a small amount of code, and it's
# heavily modified, so it's not clear to me that it's GPL-licensed...
# but you should be aware of that.  You can conservatively treat
# the override code as GPLv2:
# === begin GPLv2 ===
