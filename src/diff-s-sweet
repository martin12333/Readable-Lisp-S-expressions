# diff-s-sweet: Given two filenames
# (in s-expressions and sweet-expressions respectively),
# show the semantic differences between them.
# If there's a difference, show the difference and return an error code,
# else show nothing and return true (0).

# TODO: Add support for:
# -w Check if file list is set of well-formatted s-expressions
#    (if no files, stdin; support - as stdin)
# -u Use *only* unsweeten for actual diff s and sweet, not "sweeten".
#    This requires file 1 to be well-formatted (checked)
# -s Use *only* sweeten for actual diff s and sweet, not "unsweeten".
# Document usage, etc. in man page

# The sed commands deletes ;-only lines; the awk command
# merges 2+ blank lines into one blank line.
# We don't ignore ALL blank lines, because blank lines can have an effect.
# For example, a blank line followed by an indent has
# a different meaning if we remove the blank line.
# All of this assumes that we're not using multi-line strings.
