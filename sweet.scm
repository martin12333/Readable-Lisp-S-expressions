; Sweet-expression implementation in Scheme, 2007-10-10, version 0.15.
; Copyright (C) 2006-2007 by David A. Wheeler and Egil MÃ¶ller.
;
; This prototype code implements a reader of "sweet-expressions",
; an s-expression
; format where traditional s-expressions are usually read as-is, but
; various extensions to improve program readability are allowed.
; It adds support for indentation (as per I-expressions),
; name-prefixed function names like fact(x), and it auto-detects
; infix expressions (if 3+ parameters, 1st parameter is not infix, and
; 2nd parameter IS infix, then it's infix).  To disable infix in an
; expression, surround the 2nd parameter with as(..).
; To make it pleasant to use interactively, if you enter a single complete
; datum as unindented text followed IMMEDIATELY by a newline, it's
; run immediately-  so x, load("filename"), and (3 + 4) run immediately.
;
; TODO: There's a subtle bug involving EOF interacting with convoluted
;       constructs involving inline comments; need to track it down and fix.
;       It appears to only occur when there are multiple indented lines, all of
;       which have inline ";" comments.  This MUST be fixed before serious use.
; TODO: Leading + - . for numbers doesn't work, e.g., -5 should be allowed.
; TODO: There are a few other TODOs, e.g., bare "." processing is needed.
; TODO: There are almost certainly other bugs; this is "testing" code.
;       I'm still trying out various ideas, and in the process of trying things
;       out, other stuff breaks.  Under construction, help wanted.
; TODO: Make more portable across diff. versions of guile and of Scheme,
;       then port to Common Lisp, ACL2, etc.
; TODO: Handling "empty" lines deserves more thinking.  E.G., perhaps a blank
;       line with at least one space or tab should be completely ignored
;       (instead of closing deeper indentations).  In some cases a '()
;       is returned from whitespace that perhaps should be ignored.  The
;       sweet-load routine does not exec '() anyway.  Perhaps comment-only
;       lines should NOT count for purposes of determining indent/outdent.
; TODO: If a single-token expressions is only followed by atmosphere on a line,
;       and it's unindented, accept and run it immediately (currently that
;       disables immediate execution).
; TODO: Add optional support for R6 changes, e.g., allowing [...] lists.
;
; This is written to work with GNU guile, as a module, though it's written
; to be as portable as practicable.  Start up by typing "guile", then;
;  (use-modules (sweet))
; Then you can use it:
;  (sweet-enable)  : switches to this mode from now on.
;  (sweet-disable) : undoes sweet-enable.
;  (sweet-load filename)    : load from a file in this mode.
;  (sweet-read)    : read just one sweet-expression, and return it.
;  (sweet-filter)  ; read from stdin and display s-expr translation
;  (sweet-filter-file filename)  ; read a file and display s-expr translation
; Indentation, name-prefixing, and infix all work, but the TODOs need completion.
; Precedence is intentionally NOT supported; see the docs for why. But
; chaining is supported, so (3 + 4 + 5) works as expected.
;
; Version information:
; 0.16: Repair some whitespace skipping code (more to do, see "errors") -
;       but at least it can now correctly read the example INCLUDING comments.
; 0.15: In sweet-load, don't try to exec '().
; 0.14: Add support for parameter chaining, e.g., (3 + 4 + 5); changed
;       terminology to discuss "name-prefixing" (vs. older "name-ending" term).

; 
; Here is the grammar for the non-I-expressions (see the SFRI for
; I-expression grammar).  Note that this is slightly broader than the
; Scheme grammar, because we want to support local extensions. Thus
; this accepts symbols that are not REQUIRED to be supported by the Scheme
; spec.  In this implementation, we have two conflicting goals:
; (1) Allow running as a function without overriding "read"
; (which simplifies debugging), and (2) allow the use of local
; language extensions, particularly # stuff.  My solution is
; to have a function sweet-read that can be called directly,
; without overwriting "read", but which occasionally calls the
; underlying read implementation.  The side-effect is that
; sweet-read is disabled inside #... and string constants
; (because it calls the underlying reader).  If you set the "read"
; function to be sweet-read (as sweet-enable does), then
; no problem; this limitation is normally only important while debugging.
; 
; The grammar below is in LL(1) form, so it can be easily implemented
; using recursive descent (as this code does). Notation:
; "atm" is "atmosphere" per the Scheme spec.
; [ ... ] is optional (note the surrounding spaces);
; [...] is a regular expression (no surrounding spaces).
; Postfixed + is 1 or more, postfixed * is 0 or more, | means "or".
; 
; atm ::= newline | space | tab | semicolon anychar* newline
; 
; datum ::= '(' inside-list ')' |   ; Compound; check if infix, and if so, fix.
;           ( \' | \` | \, | ,@ ) datum |   ; abbreviation.
;                              ; quote, quasiquote, unquote, unquote-splicing
;           hashbegin | string | simplenumber | ; begin with #, ", and [0-9]
;                                               ; Call read-save to handle.
;           '.' ambiguousdot | '+' ambiguousplus | '-' ambiguousminus |
;           symbol [ ( inside-list ) ]
;                ; If (), name-prefixing; if it's infix, make ONE parameter.
;
; ambiguousminus ::= [0-9]... ;Call read-save to convert to number, then negate
; ambiguousminus ::= followed-by-atm-or-closing ; this is a lonely "-"
; ambiguousminus ::= followed-by-anything-else illegal, but quietly allow.
; ambiguousplus ::=.... just like ambiguousminus, but don't negate.
; 
; ambiguousdot ::= [0-9]+ #* [ letter [ '+' | '-' ] [0-9]+ ]
;                  ; Append "." as string, convert to number.
;                  ; I wish the syntax didn't allow numbers to begin with ".".
; ambiguousdot ::= \.\.    ; for ...
; ambiguousdot ::= (other non-atm) ; technically illegal, but quietly allow.
; ambiguousdot ::= atm     ; ILLEGAL, because not inside a list
;                  ; (This IS legal inside a list context, see below)
; 
; 
; inside-list ::= atm* [ morelist ]
; morelist ::= datum [ atm+ [ morelist | '.' atm+ datum atm* |
;                             '.' ambiguousdot morelist ] ]
;  ; Note: '.' is also in datum, but handle specially here.
;  ; inside lists is trickier than you might think!
;  ; This can be expanded into:
;  ; morelist ::= datum morelist-tail
;  ; morelist-tail ::= EMPTY | atm+ morelist-tail2
;  ; morelist-tail2 ::= EMPTY | morelist | '.' atm+ datum atm* |
;  ;                    '.' ambiguousdot morelist
;
; symbol ::= [ \ anychar |
;               any char but (,),atm,",#,  ]+
; abbreviation ::= ( \' | \` | \, | ,@ ) datum
; 
;
; Note that this LL(1) grammar is more complicated than you might
; expect, primarily because of: 
; * Leading ".": Could be a number (such as .5), the beginning of ...,
;   or a cons such as (4 . 5).
; * Leading "-": Could be a number (such as -5) or a function name, e.g.,
;                (- x 1) or -(x).
; * Leading "+": As with leading "-".
; Without these, all the "ambiguous" markers go away,
; datum and morelist become simple, and the basics are simply:
; 
; datum ::= '(' inside-list ')' | ( \' | \` | \, | ,@ ) datum |
;            hashbegin | string | number | symbol [ ( inside-list ) ]
;            Note: ENDS on ')', atmosphere (after beginning), EOF
; inside-list ::= atm* [ morelist ]
;            Note: ENDS on ')', EOF
; morelist ::= datum [ atm+ [ morelist | '.' atm+ datum atm* ] ]
;            Note: ENDS on ')', EOF
; 
; 
; 
; NOTE: 'define-module' is Guile-specific.
; Scheme has no standard module system, so this sample code
; prefixes almost everything with "sweet-" to prevent overlap
; with other names.
;
; NOTE: Use "eqv?", not "eq?", to compare characters; R5RS does not
; guarantee that two "eqv?" characters will match using "eq?".
; Use "memv" (not member or memq) to compare characters, same reason.

; This is based on Implementation of SRFI 49, directly from SRFI 49 at:
; http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/srfi-49.html
; SRFI 49 implements an "Indentation-sensitive syntax" for Scheme,
; called I-expressions.
; Sweet-expressions built on I-expressions, but add support for
; name-prefixed calls and infix, and also add some additional
; semantics based on lessons learned using I-expressions
; (if a term begins at the left edge, and ends with a newline, it's
;  run immediately so that interactive use is comfortable).
