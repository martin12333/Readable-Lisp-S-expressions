# same-sweeet-result: Given two filenames
# (in s-expressions and sweet-expressions respectively),
# determine if they mean the same thing.
# If there's a difference, show the difference and return an error code,
# else show nothing and return true (0).

# You may want to add the current directory to the PATH, e.g.:
#   PATH=".:$PATH" ./same-result file1.scm file1.sscm
