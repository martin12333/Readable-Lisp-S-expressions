# Makefile.am for "readable" project

# Usual automake header, so some auxilliary files are tucked into m4/:

ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4 --install
EXTRA_DIST = m4/DUMMY

# Incantation per GNU Standards "General Conventions for Makefiles":
SHELL = /bin/sh

# The original source files are in "src/".  At build time we create
# the guile library files in "readable/" and user-executable scripts in
# "bin/". The "bin/" scripts depend on the final GUILE_SITE location
# of the library.  These files will be installed by "make install".

# As a convenience for testing, we *also* create scripts in the *current*
# (top) directory that will depend on the local "readable/" versions,
# *EVEN IF* another version of the reable library is installed.
# This way, when testing, you can just use
# ./unsweeten (or whatever) and it will depend on the development version
# without having to set an environment variable (which is easy to forget).
# If we don't do this, it'll be easy to test the "wrong version" of the
# library, wasting time.

UNSWEETEN = ./unsweeten

# Here is the usual POSIX-portable inference rule for unsweetening:
# .sscm.scm:
#	$(UNSWEETEN) < $< > $@
# We can't use that inference rule in this makefile, because POSIX doesn't
# allow us to portably declare a dependency in inference rules.
# Since we're *building* unsweeten, we *do* have such a dependency.
# A lot of makes will let you do it anyway, as an obvious extension,
# but here we'll use the more portable approach of giving separate rules
# for each target.

# Guile libraries.
