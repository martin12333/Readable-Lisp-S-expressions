	* Release of readable software version 0.7.1.
	  - Allows a collecting list after ".", e.g. "a b . <* c *>".
	    The draft SRFI specifically gives this as an example,
	     so it'd be nice if the easily-downloaded version
	     actually supported it.
	  - Initial indents now allow "!"
	  - Adds a new tool, "diff-s-sweet"
	  - The Scheme implementation detects "*>" without matching "<*".
	  - Updates the draft SRFI-110.

	* Change to $nfx$ and $bracket-apply$ (from nfx and bracket-apply)
	* Fix reference code to make f{...}(...) be left-to-right

	   as right-to-left)
	* SRFI-105: Separate rationale from design rationale
