	* Release of readable software version 0.9.1
	  - Fixes Common Lisp tutorial, in particular, an
	    "enable-sweet" was incorrectly "enable-neoteric" making all
	    later text not work if you followed the tutorial exactly :-(.
	  - Many improvements to draft SRFI-110.html
	  - Presentation readable-s-expressions.odp has more Common Lisp info
	    and nicer formatting
	  - Common Lisp implementation improvements, e.g.,
	    better handling of EOF, examples no longer use our own ASDF,
	    and enable-... have better performance if already enabled.
	  - Add "factorial.lisp", a simple demo of how to use the
	    sweet-expressions in Common Lisp files.

	* Release of readable software version 0.9.0
	  - Adds a Common Lisp implementation (which was transliterated
	    from the Scheme implementation)
	  - Lines with at least one "!", and otherwise only indent chars,
	    are ignored, per SRFI-110 discussion
	  - Includes a draft of SRFI-110

2013-03-30 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Release of readable software version 0.7.1.
	  - Allows a collecting list after ".", e.g. "a b . <* c *>".
	    The draft SRFI-110 specifically gives this as an example,
	     so it'd be nice if the easily-downloaded version
	     actually supported it.
	  - Initial indents now allow "!"
	  - Adds a new tool, "diff-s-sweet"
	  - The Scheme implementation detects "*>" without matching "<*".
	  - Updates the draft SRFI-110.

	    both Scheme and ANTLR implementations of sweet-expressions

	* Change to $nfx$ and $bracket-apply$ (from nfx and bracket-apply)
	* Fix reference code to make f{...}(...) be left-to-right
	   (the {...} pattern was previously handled, incorrectly,
	   as right-to-left)
	* SRFI-105: Separate rationale from design rationale
