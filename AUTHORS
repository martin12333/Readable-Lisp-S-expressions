Primary authors:

* David A. Wheeler - initiator of "readable" project, created first
  drafts of specs and code.
* Alan Manuel K. Gloria - Made a number of spec suggestions and
  wrote significant pieces
* Egil MÃ¶ller - Developed SRFI-49, including its sample implementation.
  The sweet-expression indentation semantics are based on SRFI-49
  (with changes based on experimentation with it), and some of the
  implementation comes from the SRFI-49 reference implementation.
